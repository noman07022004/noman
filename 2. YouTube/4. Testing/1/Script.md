**This is Miles!**

Twelve years old. Sneakers scuffed. Backpack full of books—and secrets. By day, he's just your average middle schooler, dodging pop quizzes and cafeteria mystery meat. But when the sun sets and the city lights blink on? Miles clocks in for duty.

In the heart of a vibrant metropolis, where graffiti tells stories and music pulses through the streets, Miles lives with his tight-knit African-American family—Mom’s a nurse, Dad’s a jazz musician, and neither knows their son is a top-secret agent.

Code name: _Shadow Hawk._

From chasing data-thieves on subway rooftops to decoding messages hidden in street murals, Miles battles threats most grown-ups can’t even see coming. And yet—he still finds time to finish math homework and make it home before bedtime.

Every mission is a puzzle. Every choice matters. And behind every disguise is just a kid trying to figure it all out.

Because being a hero? That’s cool. But being _yourself_—even when the world’s counting on you—is the real challenge.

So buckle up. The city’s in danger, and Miles is on the move.  
Middle schooler by day. Secret agent by night.  
**This is Miles. And his story’s just getting started.**
