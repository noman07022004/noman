Now that you've generated a script, you need a set of minimalist stick figure prompts. The stick figure should use thin white lines on a plain black background only. Its limbs and body should be straight lines, with a simple circular head. The face should have two small dot eyes and a straight-line mouth—nothing more. For each, depict the action with precision. Ensure the action aligns with the script, maintaining a simple, minimalistic design. No shading, extra details, or artistic elements should be included beyond basic lines.

Generate one for each scene in this format:

**Example:**

**Scene 1:** A minimalist stick figure using thin white lines on a black background. The figure stands still with arms at its sides, looking straight ahead calmly.  
**Scene 2:** A minimalist stick figure using thin white lines on a black background. The figure is sitting on the ground, legs stretched out, hands resting on knees.

Ensure each description reflects the script’s events. Generate as many prompts as necessary to fully cover the entire YouTube script.
