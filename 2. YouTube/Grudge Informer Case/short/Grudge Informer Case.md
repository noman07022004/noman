A Nazi soldier returned home from the war, traumatized but relieved to finally see his wife again.

Haunted by horrors, he spoke out against Hitler. His wife comforted him.

Later, his wife quietly reported him to the Nazis.

He was arrested, and during his trial, he was sentenced to death based on his wife’s testimony.

After the fall of the Nazis, his wife was put on trial.

Her defense was simple: “I was just following the law.”

But the court uncovered the truth: she hadn’t reported her husband out of loyalty to the law; rather, she had been having an affair and used the system to get rid of her husband.

She was sentenced to imprisonment not for reporting her husband to his death, but for abusing the law.

Do you agree with the court’s reasoning for punishing her?
