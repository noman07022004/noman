During World War II, a Nazi soldier came home on short leave. He was completely shattered by the horrors of the war. Feeling safe in his wife's embrace, he expressed his frustration with Hitler. She comforted him… then quietly reported him to the Nazis.

He was arrested and sentenced to death for his words.

After the fall of the Nazi regime, the wife was put on trial. In her defense, she claimed she had done nothing wrong—she was simply following the law.

But the court uncovered more: while her husband was away at war, she had been having an affair—and used the system to get rid of him.

The court declared her guilty—not for betraying her husband to his death, but for abusing the law for personal gain.

Do you agree with the court’s reasoning?
