**Script with Variation Cues:**

During World War II, a Nazi soldier came home on short leave.  
He was **completely shattered**↑ by the horrors of the war.//

Feeling **safe**↑ in his wife's embrace,//  
he expressed his **frustration with Hitler**↑.//  
She comforted him… //then **quietly reported him**↑ to the Nazis.//

He was **arrested**↑ and **sentenced to death**↑ for his words.//

After the fall of the Nazi regime,//  
the wife was put on trial.//

In her defense,// she claimed she had done **nothing wrong**↑—//  
she was simply **following the law**↑.//

But the court uncovered more:  
while her husband was away at war,//  
she had been **having an affair**↑—  
and used the system to **get rid of him**↑.//

The court declared her **guilty**↑—  
not for betraying her husband to his death,//  
but for **abusing the law**↑ for **personal gain**↑.//

**Do you agree**↑ with the court’s reasoning?//
