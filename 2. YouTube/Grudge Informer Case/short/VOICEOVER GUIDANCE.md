### 🎬 Bonus Tips:

- **Record in a quiet space.** Use a decent mic or your phone’s voice recorder in a car or closet (for good acoustics).
    
- **Use light background music** if possible: subtle piano, ambient tension, or emotional strings.
    
- **End with a pause** after the final question to let it breathe before the Short cuts off.
