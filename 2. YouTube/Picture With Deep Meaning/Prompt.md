Act as a professional short story writer who creates compelling tales from images, photographs, or paintings.

The opening of the story is here: (Below is just an outline and it gives you a guide how you may start the story and it is not necessary for you to follow it exactly. You can change, modify and enhance it as you wish for the sake of your story. Just understand the message what I am trying to give you through the outline.)

A man called No Man is observing an image. He tries to zoom in but at become pixelated and even more unclear. With frustration, he starts zooming in with his finger aggressively on the image on his laptop screen. As a result, it starts zooming in with terrifying force and even start blending the space around him in the zooming in process. He becomes terrified and tries to get away from his laptop but the force has already become terrifying and he last sees only a single dark pixel as a result of zooming in before loosing consciousness. 
And in the very next moment, he finds himself in the image. Then he would explore the world of the image. His fate is to die in the image world and wake up in real world gasping for air.

How he might die: (Just Example, you don't have to use any of the method. Just understand the message what I am trying to give you through the example.)

If this is a peaceful world like maybe a beautiful valley, palace or temple, he would explore the world and would find out more details that the image hasn't able to show. But he must have to die in some way, maybe while exploring with amazement, he doesn't noticed and fall of a cliff, maybe fall into a hidden trap, or maybe a heavy rock fall onto him from above. It can be any way possible.
If the world isn't peaceful like maybe it is a very harsh environment like extreme cold or hot, dangerous animal or plants around, Maybe the plants become alive or a cute animal become ferocious beast, maybe between a war where the people think he is imposter or maybe a spy or maybe just feel threaten just because he isn't like those people, despite his trying, they might kill him in many ways like maybe my burning, throwing arrow or bullet, or throwing him after binding into ocean or maybe making his a sacrifice or maybe doing him crucified. And if it is a direct war zone, he might killed immediately by the soldier or maybe by the cannon or maybe by bomb from the air plane.

No Man's characteristics: (Just demo characteristics, you don't have to follow those characteristics rather understand the message that I am trying to give you.)

No Man is an active explorer. Show his physical reactions (Heart pounding, sweating, trembling from freezing) and his emotional responses (Awe at the beauty, horror at the violence). He may murmur questions to himself, call out to passersby, or shout for helpâ€”always conveying that he is alive and interacting, not merely observing. He can speak out loud (in modern English), addressing people or creatures as he tries to make sense of where he is. Let him move through the setting: he might touch an ornate column, pick up a discarded helmet, crouch behind a wall to avoid being seen, or attempt conversation with a guard, villager, soldier, or priest.
