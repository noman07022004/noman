### **Lahore Resolution (1940): A Comprehensive Overview**

The **Lahore Resolution**, also known as the **Pakistan Resolution**, was a landmark political statement adopted on **March 23, 1940**, during the annual session of the **All India Muslim League** in Lahore. It laid the foundation for the demand for an independent Muslim state, which later led to the creation of **Pakistan** in 1947.

## **Background**

1. **Political Climate in British India:**
    
    - The demand for constitutional reforms and self-rule in India intensified in the early 20th century.
    - The **Indian National Congress** (INC) primarily represented Hindu-majority interests.
    - The **Muslim League**, formed in 1906, emerged to safeguard Muslim rights in a Hindu-majority India.
    - The **1937 provincial elections**, held under the **Government of India Act, 1935**, saw the Congress form governments in multiple provinces, marginalizing the Muslim League.
    - The fear of Hindu dominance over Muslims increased, leading to the demand for a separate homeland.
2. **Allama Iqbal’s Vision (1930):**
    
    - The idea of a separate Muslim state was first articulated by **Dr. Muhammad Iqbal** in his **Allahabad Address (1930)**.
    - He suggested that Muslims of the subcontinent were a distinct nation deserving of political autonomy.
3. **Two-Nation Theory:**
    
    - Promoted by **Muhammad Ali Jinnah**, it argued that Hindus and Muslims were two separate nations with distinct cultures, religions, and ways of life.
    - The theory emphasized that Muslims would struggle to safeguard their rights in a united India dominated by Hindus.
