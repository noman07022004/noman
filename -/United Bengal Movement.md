### Comprehensive Overview of the United Bangla Movement

The **United Bangla Movement** was an effort to create an undivided Bengal as an independent or autonomous state during the final years of British rule in India. The movement aimed to prevent the partition of Bengal along religious lines in 1947. However, despite various efforts, Bengal was ultimately divided into **West Bengal (India)** and **East Pakistan (later Bangladesh).**

## 1. Background of the United Bangla Movement

### a. Historical Context: Bengal’s Importance

- Bengal was a major economic and cultural hub in British India, known for its **intellectual, political, and economic influence.**
- **Partition of Bengal (1905)** by Lord Curzon had earlier divided the province for administrative reasons, sparking nationalist protests and leading to its reunification in **1911.**
- The **idea of a united Bengal** gained traction in the 1940s as independence neared, with concerns about communal division growing.

### b. Religious & Political Divisions

- Bengal had a **Muslim majority** (56%), but a strong Hindu minority (44%).
- The **Muslim League**, led by **Muhammad Ali Jinnah**, supported Bengal's inclusion in Pakistan, while the **Indian National Congress** wanted it to remain in India.
- Some Bengali leaders sought an **independent, united Bengal** instead of division between India and Pakistan.

## 3. The United Bengal Proposal (1947)

### a. The Idea of an Independent Bengal

- Suhrawardy and Bose proposed that **Bengal should remain undivided and form an independent state** rather than be split between India and Pakistan.
- The new Bengal would be a **sovereign state**, neither part of India nor Pakistan, and would ensure **communal harmony**.

### b. Political Challenges

- **Muslim League’s Dilemma**: Jinnah was open to the idea but preferred Bengal to join Pakistan.
- **Congress Opposition**: **Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel** rejected the idea, fearing that a separate Bengal could weaken India.
- **Hindu Mahasabha & Shyama Prasad Mukherjee**: Strongly opposed the idea, fearing Hindu minority oppression in a Muslim-majority Bengal.

### c. British Position

- **Lord Mountbatten**, the last Viceroy of India, **did not support an independent Bengal**, citing administrative difficulties.

## 4. Failure of the United Bengal Movement

### a. Lack of Support from Major Political Forces

- The movement lacked backing from either the **Congress or the Muslim League**, making it politically unviable.
- Hindu leaders in Bengal and **Hindu-majority provinces of India opposed the idea**.

### b. Communal Riots & Public Sentiment

- The **Calcutta Riots (1946)** and **Noakhali Riots (1946)** worsened Hindu-Muslim tensions.
- The idea of a united Bengal struggled to gain mass support amidst increasing communal violence.

### c. The Mountbatten Plan (June 3, 1947)

- The British government **finalized the partition of India**.
- Bengal was officially divided into:
    - **West Bengal (India) – Hindu-majority**
    - **East Pakistan (Pakistan) – Muslim-majority (later Bangladesh in 1971)**

## 5. Consequences of the Movement’s Failure

### a. Partition of Bengal (1947)

- Bengal was split into **West Bengal (India)** and **East Pakistan (later Bangladesh).**
- **Mass migrations, communal riots, and violence** followed, displacing millions.

### b. Refugee Crisis & Long-Term Impacts

- **Millions of Hindus migrated to India** from East Pakistan.
- **Muslim migration to East Pakistan** also occurred, though in smaller numbers.
- The legacy of division continued with the **Bangladesh Liberation War (1971)**, leading to the formation of **Bangladesh.**

### c. Political Aftermath

- The failure of a **unified Bengal idea** led to increased sectarian divisions.
- **West Bengal remained part of secular India**, while **East Pakistan struggled under Pakistani rule until 1971.**

## 6. Conclusion

The **United Bengal Movement** was a unique but unsuccessful attempt to keep Bengal undivided in 1947. Despite support from leaders like **Suhrawardy and Sarat Bose**, the movement failed due to lack of political backing, communal violence, and opposition from both Indian and Pakistani leadership.

While the movement did not succeed, its legacy remains in discussions on Bengal's history, identity, and the long-term consequences of partition.
