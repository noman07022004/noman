### **Beginning of the Adalat System: Warren Hastings's Measures**

Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of Bengal (1772â€“1785), played a pivotal role in reforming and consolidating British administration in India. His judicial reforms, particularly the introduction of the **Adalat system**, marked the beginning of a structured and territorially based judicial framework under British rule. These measures were aimed at addressing the chaotic and inconsistent legal arrangements that existed prior to 1772.

### **1. Warren Hastings as Governor-General: Role and Context**
Warren Hastings assumed office during a period of administrative turmoil in British India. The East India Company faced challenges such as:

- **Financial instability**: The Company was deeply indebted due to corruption and mismanagement.
- **Administrative disarray**: There was no clear separation between revenue collection and judicial functions, leading to widespread exploitation.
- **Judicial chaos**: Pre-existing systems were fragmented, with overlapping jurisdictions and arbitrary decisions.

Hastings recognized the need for systematic reforms to consolidate British authority and improve governance. His judicial reforms were part of broader efforts to stabilize and legitimize British rule.

### **2. Defects of the Existing Judicial System (Pre-1772)**
Before 1772, the judicial system in Bengal was plagued by numerous shortcomings:

- **Lack of Clear Jurisdiction**: Different courts operated without defined boundaries, leading to confusion.
- **Inconsistencies in Law**: Personal laws of Hindus and Muslims were applied arbitrarily, while European settlers often claimed immunity from local courts.
- **Corruption and Exploitation**: Revenue collectors (Zamindars) doubled as judges, resulting in biased and exploitative decisions.
- **Absence of Territorial Courts**: The judicial system was confined to Presidency towns, leaving rural areas largely unregulated.

These defects necessitated a comprehensive overhaul of the judicial structure.

### **3. Judicial Plan of 1772: Key Features**
The **Judicial Plan of 1772** introduced significant reforms to establish a more organized and equitable judicial system. Its key features included:

#### **(a) Establishment of Diwani Adalats (Civil Courts) and Faujdari Adalats (Criminal Courts)**
- **Diwani Adalats**: Civil courts were established in each district to handle civil disputes, including property, contracts, debts, and inheritance.
- **Faujdari Adalats**: Criminal courts were set up in districts to deal with criminal cases, such as theft, robbery, and homicide.

#### **(b) Hierarchy of Courts**
Hastings created a hierarchical court system to ensure systematic administration of justice:
- **District-Level Courts**: 
  - **Diwani Adalats**: Presided over by District Collectors, who also acted as judges.
  - **Faujdari Adalats**: Operated under the supervision of Muslim Qazis and Muftis, with European officials overseeing proceedings.
- **Sadr Adalats (Chief Courts)**:
  - **Sadr Diwani Adalat**: Appellate court for civil cases, located in Calcutta.
  - **Sadr Nizamat Adalat**: Appellate court for criminal cases, also based in Calcutta.

This hierarchy ensured that appeals could be heard at higher levels, providing a mechanism for redressal.

#### **(c) Separation of Judicial and Revenue Functions (Partial)**
- Hastings attempted to separate judicial and revenue functions by assigning distinct roles to District Collectors and judges. However, this separation was only partial, as Collectors continued to wield considerable influence over both domains.

#### **(d) Application of Personal Laws**
- In **civil matters**, the personal laws of Hindus and Muslims were applied, ensuring respect for religious customs.
- In **criminal matters**, Muslim law (Islamic Shariat) was followed, but with modifications to align with British notions of justice.

### **4. Significance of the Adalat System**
The Judicial Plan of 1772 laid the foundation for a more organized and structured judicial system under British control. Its significance can be summarized as follows:

#### **(a) Foundation of the Adalat System**
- The plan introduced the concept of **territorial courts**, extending judicial administration beyond Presidency towns to rural areas.
- It created a **hierarchical structure** of courts, ensuring uniformity and accountability.

#### **(b) First Major Attempt Beyond Presidency Towns**
- For the first time, the British extended their judicial reforms to the provinces, signaling their intent to govern the entire territory systematically.

#### **(c) Respect for Religious Laws**
- By applying Hindu and Muslim personal laws in civil matters, Hastings acknowledged the importance of cultural and religious traditions, fostering a degree of legitimacy.

#### **(d) Limitations**
- Despite its progressive aspects, the system retained elements of colonial bias, such as the dominance of European officials in oversight roles.
- The partial separation of judicial and revenue functions left room for abuse and inefficiency.
