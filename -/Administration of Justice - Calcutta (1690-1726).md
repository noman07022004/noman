### **Administration of Justice: Calcutta (1690-1726)**

The administration of justice in Calcutta during the period from 1690 to 1726 reflects the early colonial efforts of the British East India Company to establish a legal system in Bengal, adapting English legal principles to local customs and administrative needs. This period saw the gradual evolution of judicial institutions, shaped by the unique socio-economic and political conditions of the region.

### **1. Establishment of Calcutta: Foundation of Fort William and the Rise of Calcutta Presidency**
- **Foundation of Fort William (1690):**
  - In 1690, Job Charnock, an agent of the British East India Company, established a trading post at Sutanuti (modern-day Kolkata).
  - The settlement grew rapidly due to its strategic location on the Hooghly River, and in 1696, the East India Company began constructing **Fort William** to protect the settlement.
  - Calcutta became the administrative and commercial hub of British activities in Bengal.

- **Rise of Calcutta Presidency:**
  - Over time, Calcutta expanded beyond the fort, becoming one of the three major presidencies of British India (alongside Madras and Bombay).
  - The **Calcutta Presidency** emerged as a significant center of colonial governance, trade, and revenue collection in eastern India.

### **2. Zemindari System (Early Calcutta)**
- **Initial Zemindari Rights:**
  - The East India Company obtained **zemindari rights** over the villages surrounding Calcutta in 1698.
  - These rights allowed the Company to collect revenue from the local population, effectively making it the landlord of the area.
  - The acquisition of zemindari rights marked the beginning of the Company's direct involvement in revenue administration and local governance.

- **Impact on Judicial Administration:**
  - The zemindari system introduced a new layer of authority, with zamindars (landlords) playing a role in resolving disputes related to land and revenue.
  - However, the Company retained overall control, ensuring that revenue collection and dispute resolution aligned with its interests.

### **3. Collector’s Court (Early Judicial Role)**
- **Collector as Judge:**
  - The **Collector**, initially appointed to oversee revenue collection, also assumed judicial responsibilities.
  - This dual role reflected the practical realities of colonial governance, where administrative and judicial functions were often combined.

- **Jurisdiction (Revenue and Petty Civil/Criminal):**
  - **Revenue Matters:** The Collector primarily dealt with disputes related to land revenue, rent, and taxation.
  - **Petty Civil and Criminal Cases:** The Collector also resolved minor civil disputes (e.g., debts, contracts) and criminal cases (e.g., theft, assault) among Indian inhabitants.
  - **Procedure:** The procedures were informal, relying on local customs and arbitration to resolve disputes.

- **Limitations:**
  - The Collector's court lacked formal structure and was often criticized for inefficiency and bias.
  - Its jurisdiction was limited to petty matters, with more significant disputes referred to higher authorities.

### **4. Governor and Council in Calcutta (Appellate and Original Jurisdiction)**
- **Higher Judicial Authority:**
  - Similar to Madras, the **Governor and Council of Fort William** exercised superior judicial powers in Calcutta.
  - They served as the highest appellate authority, hearing appeals from lower courts such as the Collector’s Court.
  - The Governor and Council also had original jurisdiction over major civil and criminal cases involving Europeans, high-ranking officials, and significant financial matters.

- **Appeals to England:**
  - In theory, litigants could appeal to the **East India Company’s Court of Directors** in England.
  - However, such appeals were rarely used in practice due to the long distances, high costs, and delays involved.

### **5. Contrasts with Madras**
- **Geographical and Administrative Differences:**
  - **Madras:** The judicial system in Madras evolved around the **Mayor’s Court**, which was formally established in 1687 to handle civil disputes among European settlers.
  - **Calcutta:** In contrast, the judicial system in Calcutta remained more informal and heavily reliant on the **Collector’s Court** and local customs during this period.

- **Role of Zamindars:**
  - In Calcutta, the **zamindari system** played a more prominent role in dispute resolution, particularly in rural areas.
  - In Madras, while zamindars existed, their influence on the judicial system was less pronounced compared to Calcutta.

- **Revenue Focus:**
  - The judicial system in Calcutta was closely tied to revenue administration, reflecting the importance of land revenue in Bengal.
  - In Madras, the focus was more on trade and commerce, leading to the establishment of formal courts like the Mayor’s Court to address disputes among merchants.

- **Cultural Context:**
  - The judicial system in Calcutta was deeply influenced by the prevailing **Hindu and Muslim customs** of Bengal.
  - In Madras, the system was shaped by the customs of South India, with a stronger emphasis on integrating English common law principles.
