### Secular Natural Law: Thomas Hobbes (Continued)

#### 1. **Sovereign Power: Absolute Sovereignty**
Hobbes places immense emphasis on the need for a powerful, undivided sovereign to enforce the social contract. He argues that without such authority, society risks collapsing back into the violent and chaotic state of nature. His belief in absolute sovereignty stems from several key considerations:

- **Prevention of Anarchy**: The sovereign must have sufficient power to prevent internal conflicts and maintain peace. Divided or weak authority creates opportunities for rebellion and disorder.
- **Fear of Punishment**: Hobbes believes humans are inherently self-interested and require fear of punishment to comply with laws. Only an absolute sovereign can instill this fear effectively.
- **Practicality over Idealism**: Hobbes prioritizes stability over ideals like justice or liberty. A strong central authority ensures that laws are enforced consistently, even if it means sacrificing some individual freedoms.

Absolute sovereignty, for Hobbes, does not mean tyranny but rather the concentration of power necessary to fulfill the purpose of government: maintaining order and protecting citizens' lives.

#### 2. **Law as Command of the Sovereign**
Hobbes defines law as the "command of the sovereign," reflecting an early form of **legal positivism**—the idea that law is a human construct independent of morality or divine will. Key aspects of his definition include:

- **Law is Artificial, Not Natural**: Laws are created by the sovereign to regulate behavior and maintain order; they are not derived from natural or moral principles.
- **The Sovereign's Will Defines Law**: Since the sovereign represents the collective will of the people under the social contract, their commands become binding laws. This separates law from subjective interpretations of morality.
- **Obedience to the Law Ensures Peace**: For Hobbes, obeying the law is essential for escaping the state of nature. Even unjust laws must be followed because disobedience threatens societal stability.

This view contrasts sharply with earlier theories that tied law to divine command or natural justice. Hobbes’s approach emphasizes legality over morality, laying the groundwork for modern legal systems where laws derive legitimacy from procedural enactment rather than inherent righteousness.

#### 3. **Natural Rights (Right to Self-Preservation)**
In Hobbes’s framework, the only fundamental natural right is the **right to self-preservation**—the instinctual drive to protect one’s life and avoid harm. This shapes his legal theory in significant ways:

- **Foundation of the Social Contract**: Individuals agree to surrender certain freedoms to the sovereign because they believe it will better secure their survival. The right to self-preservation motivates this exchange.
- **Limitation on Sovereign Power**: While Hobbes advocates for absolute sovereignty, he acknowledges that the sovereign cannot demand actions that directly threaten individuals’ lives. For example, subjects are not obligated to fight in wars if doing so would lead to certain death.
- **Focus on Survival Over Liberty**: By prioritizing self-preservation, Hobbes downplays other rights, such as freedom of speech or property, which might conflict with the needs of the state. This reflects his pragmatic focus on minimizing violence and ensuring basic survival.

The right to self-preservation underscores Hobbes’s utilitarian approach to governance: laws and institutions exist primarily to reduce existential threats and maximize security.

#### 4. **Critique of Hobbes**
While Hobbes’s theories were groundbreaking, they have faced significant criticism over time. Some of the main critiques include:

- **Too Authoritarian**: Critics argue that Hobbes’s insistence on absolute sovereignty grants excessive power to the ruler, potentially enabling abuse or oppression. There are no checks and balances to prevent the sovereign from acting tyrannically.
  - Example: If the sovereign becomes corrupt or unjust, there is no mechanism for accountability or resistance within Hobbes’s framework.
  
- **Neglect of Justice and Individual Liberties**: Hobbes prioritizes order and security above all else, often at the expense of justice, fairness, and personal freedoms.
  - Example: His dismissal of natural rights beyond self-preservation leaves little room for protections against violations of privacy, expression, or autonomy.
  
- **Pessimistic View of Human Nature**: Hobbes’s assumption that humans are inherently selfish and prone to violence has been challenged by later thinkers who emphasize cooperation, empathy, and altruism.
  - Example: Rousseau argued that humans are naturally good and corrupted by society, offering a more optimistic counterpoint to Hobbes’s bleak portrayal.

- **Lack of Democratic Participation**: Hobbes’s model grants the sovereign unilateral authority without requiring input or consent from the governed after the initial social contract. This undermines democratic principles of representation and accountability.

Despite these criticisms, Hobbes’s work remains foundational for understanding the balance between individual rights and collective security—a tension that continues to shape political philosophy today.

### Final Answer
Thomas Hobbes’s emphasis on absolute sovereignty, his definition of law as the sovereign’s command, and his focus on the natural right to self-preservation reflect a pragmatic yet controversial approach to governance. While his ideas provide a robust framework for maintaining order and security, they have been criticized for being overly authoritarian, neglecting justice and individual liberties, and relying on a pessimistic view of human nature. Despite these critiques, Hobbes’s contributions remain pivotal in exploring the relationship between authority, law, and human survival.

**Boxed Final Answer:**  
**{Hobbes advocates for absolute sovereignty to enforce the social contract, defines law as the sovereign’s command (early legal positivism), and centers his legal theory on the natural right to self-preservation. Criticisms include its authoritarian tendencies, neglect of justice and liberties, and reliance on a bleak view of human nature.}**
