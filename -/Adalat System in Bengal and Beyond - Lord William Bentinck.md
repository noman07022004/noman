### **1. Lord William Bentinck as Governor-General (Context)**

#### **(a) Era of Reforms**
- **Utilitarian Influence**: Bentinck was deeply influenced by utilitarian thinkers like James Mill and Jeremy Bentham, who advocated for governance based on principles of "the greatest happiness for the greatest number."
- **Liberal Ideals**: He embraced liberal ideas of reducing costs, simplifying procedures, and making justice more accessible to all sections of society.
- **Economic Constraints**: The East India Company faced financial difficulties, necessitating cost-cutting measures in administration, including the judiciary.
- **Social Reforms**: Bentinck is also known for his social reforms, such as the abolition of Sati (1829) and suppression of thuggee (organized highway robbery and murder). His judicial reforms complemented these broader efforts to modernize Indian society.

#### **(b) Need for Judicial Reform**
By the early 19th century, the Adalat system established under Cornwallis had become outdated and inefficient. Bentinck recognized the need for reform to address growing criticisms and improve the administration of justice.

### **2. Criticisms of the Existing Adalat System (Early 19th Century)**

The Adalat system inherited from Cornwallis was plagued by several flaws:

- **Delays in Justice**: Cases often took years to resolve due to procedural complexities and a lack of adequate judicial infrastructure.
- **Complexity**: The legal procedures were overly complicated, making it difficult for ordinary litigants to navigate the system.
- **High Costs**: Litigation was expensive, disproportionately affecting poorer sections of society.
- **Continued Use of Persian**: Persian, the official language of courts, was inaccessible to most Indians, especially in rural areas.
- **Lack of Uniformity**: There were inconsistencies in the application of laws across different regions and courts.
- **Inefficiency of Judges**: Many judges lacked proper training, leading to arbitrary and inconsistent decisions.

These criticisms highlighted the urgent need for comprehensive judicial reform.

### **3. Bentinck's Broad Objectives for Judicial Reform**

Bentinck's judicial reforms were guided by the following objectives:

- **Efficiency**: Streamlining procedures to reduce delays and ensure timely delivery of justice.
- **Accessibility**: Making the judicial system more accessible to all sections of society, including rural populations.
- **Anglicization**: Replacing Persian with English as the language of the higher courts and vernacular languages in lower courts to promote transparency and understanding.
- **Greater Uniformity**: Standardizing laws and procedures across different regions to ensure consistency and fairness.
- **Cost Reduction**: Simplifying legal processes to make litigation more affordable for the general population.

These objectives reflected Bentinck's commitment to utilitarian and liberal ideals, aiming to create a more equitable and efficient judicial system.

### **4. Focus on Bengal Reforms First**

Bentinck's judicial reforms initially focused on the **Bengal Presidency**, which served as a model for subsequent reforms in other regions.

#### **(a) Key Reforms in Bengal**
- **Abolition of Persian (1837)**:
  - Persian was replaced with **English** as the official language of the higher courts (Sadr Diwani Adalat and Sadr Nizamat Adalat).
  - Vernacular languages were introduced in lower courts to make justice more accessible to the local population.
  - This change marked a significant shift toward Anglicization and reduced the influence of Persian-speaking elites.

- **Reduction in Number of Courts**:
  - Bentinck consolidated the hierarchy of courts to eliminate redundancies and reduce costs.
  - Lower-level courts were streamlined, and overlapping jurisdictions were addressed to improve efficiency.

- **Introduction of Professional Judges**:
  - Efforts were made to appoint trained and qualified judges to ensure impartiality and competence.
  - The role of Qazis and Muftis in criminal courts was further reduced, reflecting the diminishing reliance on traditional Islamic law.

- **Simplification of Procedures**:
  - Legal procedures were simplified to reduce delays and costs.
  - Emphasis was placed on expediting trials and ensuring that cases were resolved within a reasonable timeframe.

- **Extension of Jurisdiction**:
  - The jurisdiction of civil and criminal courts was expanded to cover a wider range of disputes, ensuring greater access to justice for rural populations.

#### **(b) Extension to Other Regions**
After successfully implementing these reforms in Bengal, Bentinck extended similar measures to the **North-Western Provinces** and other regions under British control. This ensured greater uniformity in the administration of justice across British India.
