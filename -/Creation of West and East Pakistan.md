### History of Bangladesh: Creation of West and East Pakistan (1947)

#### 1. **Partition of India (1947):**

- **Background:** The British Raj, which had ruled over India for nearly two centuries, was divided into two independent nations in 1947â€”India and Pakistan. This division was based largely on religious lines, with Pakistan being created as a homeland for Muslims, while India remained a secular state with a majority Hindu population.
- **Partition:** The decision was made by the Indian Independence Act 1947, passed by the British Parliament. Pakistan was divided into two geographically separated regions: West Pakistan (modern-day Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The division caused mass migrations and horrific communal violence, as millions of Hindus and Muslims crossed borders to join their respective new nations.

#### 2. **East Pakistan:**

- **Geographical Separation:** East Pakistan was located on the eastern side of the Indian subcontinent, separated from West Pakistan by about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) of Indian territory. The two regions shared little in terms of culture, language, and administration.
- **Economic and Political Marginalization:** Although East Pakistan had a larger population than West Pakistan, it was consistently sidelined in the political and economic affairs of the country. The majority of the political power remained in West Pakistan, while East Pakistan remained underdeveloped in comparison, despite its significant contributions to Pakistan's economy, especially through the production of jute, which was a key export.

#### 3. **Initial Hopes and Realities:**

- **Hopes:** Initially, there was optimism in East Pakistan about the creation of Pakistan, with many hoping for economic opportunities and greater political influence. Many believed that the newly formed Pakistan would ensure Muslim unity and prosperity across the subcontinent.
- **Realities:** However, early expectations were met with the reality of inequality and neglect. The political system was centralized in West Pakistan, and the leaders of the newly formed country, primarily from the West, failed to address the needs and aspirations of the Bengali-speaking population in the East. Over time, East Pakistan began to feel increasingly marginalized, particularly as the political power structure continued to be dominated by West Pakistan.

The differences in language, culture, and identity further strained relations between the two regions, setting the stage for political discontent that would later evolve into the demand for autonomy and eventually lead to the independence movement of Bangladesh.
