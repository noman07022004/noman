### **Beginning of the Adalat System: Judicial Plan of 1772 and the Supreme Court of Calcutta**

The **Judicial Plan of 1772** and the establishment of the **Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Calcutta (1774)** marked significant milestones in the evolution of British judicial administration in India. These developments introduced a structured legal framework while also creating tensions between the King's Court and the Company's Adalat system.

### **1. Judicial Plan of 1772: Detailed Aspects**
Warren Hastings' **Judicial Plan of 1772** aimed to reform the chaotic and inconsistent judicial arrangements in Bengal by introducing a systematic hierarchy of courts.

#### **(a) Composition and Jurisdiction of Diwani and Faujdari Adalats at District Level**
- **Diwani Adalats (Civil Courts):**
  - **Presiding Authority**: District Collectors presided over these courts.
  - **Jurisdiction**: Handled civil disputes such as property, contracts, debts, inheritance, and other monetary matters.
  - **Law Applied**: Personal laws of Hindus and Muslims were applied in civil cases, ensuring respect for religious customs.

- **Faujdari Adalats (Criminal Courts):**
  - **Presiding Authority**: Operated under Muslim Qazis and Muftis, with European officials overseeing proceedings.
  - **Jurisdiction**: Dealt with criminal cases like theft, robbery, murder, and other offenses.
  - **Law Applied**: Islamic Shariat law was followed, but modified to align with British notions of justice.

#### **(b) Sadr Diwani Adalat and Sadr Nizamat Adalat at Calcutta**
- **Sadr Diwani Adalat (Chief Civil Court):**
  - **Composition**: Presided over by the Governor and Council of Bengal.
  - **Jurisdiction**: Functioned as an appellate court for civil cases from district-level Diwani Adalats.
  - **Role**: Provided a mechanism for redressal of grievances and ensured uniformity in civil justice.

- **Sadr Nizamat Adalat (Chief Criminal Court):**
  - **Composition**: Headed by the Nizam (Governor) and assisted by Muslim law officers (Qazis and Muftis).
  - **Jurisdiction**: Served as the appellate court for criminal cases from Faujdari Adalats.
  - **Role**: Ensured oversight of criminal justice administration.

### **2. Defects and Limitations of the 1772 Plan**
Despite its progressive aspects, the Judicial Plan of 1772 had several shortcomings:

- **Lack of Legal Expertise**: District Collectors, who presided over Diwani Adalats, often lacked formal legal training, leading to inconsistent and arbitrary decisions.
- **Overlapping Jurisdictions**: The dual roles of District Collectors as revenue collectors and judges created conflicts of interest.
- **Limited Territorial Scope**: The reforms were confined to Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, leaving other regions untouched.
- **Partial Separation of Functions**: The separation of judicial and revenue functions remained incomplete, perpetuating inefficiencies.
- **Colonial Bias**: The dominance of European officials in oversight roles reflected the colonial nature of the system.

These limitations highlighted the need for further reforms.

### **3. Regulating Act of 1773**
The **Regulating Act of 1773**, passed by the British Parliament, sought to address the administrative and financial chaos within the East India Company. Its key provisions included:

- Establishment of the office of **Governor-General of Bengal** (Warren Hastings became the first incumbent).
- Creation of a **Supreme Court in Calcutta** to oversee judicial matters.
- Introduction of a **Governor-General-in-Council** to improve decision-making.

The Act was a response to growing criticism of the Company's mismanagement and aimed to bring greater accountability to its operations.

### **4. Establishment of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Calcutta (1774)**
The **Charter of 1774** established the **Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Calcutta**, marking the creation of a separate, powerful King's Court.

#### **(a) Purpose**
The Supreme Court was established to:
- Remedy perceived defects in the Company's judicial system.
- Provide a superior court of law for British subjects and others residing in the Company's service.
- Ensure the application of English law and principles of justice.

#### **(b) Charter of 1774: Key Provisions**
- **Composition**: The court consisted of a Chief Justice and three Puisne Judges, all appointed by the Crown.
- **Jurisdiction**:
  - **Original Jurisdiction**: Over all British subjects in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, and over those employed by or in the service of the East India Company.
  - **Limited Jurisdiction over Indians**: Controversially, the court's jurisdiction extended to Indians only if they were in the Company's service or consented to its authority.
  - **No Jurisdiction over Revenue Matters**: The court could not interfere in revenue collection or related disputes.
  - **Ecclesiastical and Admiralty Jurisdiction**: It handled cases involving church matters and maritime disputes.

- **Law Applied**: English common law and statutes were applied, supplemented by principles of equity and good conscience where necessary.

#### **(c) Significance**
- **Separate King's Court**: The Supreme Court operated independently of the Company's Adalat system, creating a dual judicial structure.
- **Conflicts and Jurisdictional Disputes**: The overlapping jurisdictions of the Supreme Court and the Adalat system led to frequent clashes. For example:
  - The Supreme Court claimed authority over Indians indirectly affected by disputes involving British subjects.
  - The Company's courts resisted interference in their domain, particularly revenue matters.
- **Impact on Legal Development**: Despite its controversies, the Supreme Court introduced English legal principles and procedures, influencing the evolution of Indian jurisprudence.

### **5. Conclusion**
The **Judicial Plan of 1772** and the establishment of the **Supreme Court of Calcutta (1774)** represented significant steps toward the development of a formal judicial system in British India. While the 1772 plan laid the foundation for a structured hierarchy of civil and criminal courts, it suffered from limitations such as the lack of legal expertise and overlapping jurisdictions. The **Supreme Court**, though intended to remedy these issues, created further tensions due to its dual existence alongside the Company's Adalat system. Together, these measures reflected the complexities and challenges of imposing a colonial legal framework on a diverse and vast subcontinent.

**Final Answer**: The Judicial Plan of 1772 introduced a structured Adalat system with district-level Diwani and Faujdari Adalats and apex Sadr Adalats in Calcutta. However, its limitations necessitated further reforms. The establishment of the Supreme Court of Calcutta in 1774, through the Charter of 1774, created a separate King's Court applying English law, leading to jurisdictional conflicts with the Company's Adalat system. These developments marked the beginning of a dual judicial structure in British India.
