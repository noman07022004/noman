The **Charter of 1661** was a significant legal document issued by King **Charles II of England** to the **East India Company (EIC)**. It granted the Company extensive powers, marking a crucial step in the development of British legal authority in India.

### **Key Features of the Charter of 1661:**

1. **Judicial Authority to the Company**

    - These laws had to be consistent with English law but were enforceable by the Company.
2. **Powers to Establish Courts**
    
    - The Company could establish judicial institutions and appoint officials to administer justice.
    - Governors and councils in various settlements (such as Bombay and Madras) were given the power to act as judges and magistrates.
3. **Enforcement of Laws**
    
    - The Company was given the authority to punish its employees and subjects, including Englishmen and locals, for crimes committed within its territories.
    - It could impose fines, imprison individuals, and, in extreme cases, execute the death penalty.
