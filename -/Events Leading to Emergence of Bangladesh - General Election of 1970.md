### Events Leading to the Emergence of Bangladesh: General Election of 1970

The **General Election of 1970** was a watershed moment in the history of Pakistan and played a pivotal role in the eventual emergence of Bangladesh. It was the first-ever direct election held in Pakistan, following years of military rule under Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan. The election results were historic, as they reflected the clear political aspirations of the people of East Pakistan but also exposed the deep divisions between East and West Pakistan.

### **Context**
The **Mass Uprising of 1969** and the subsequent fall of Ayub Khan created an opportunity for restoring democracy in Pakistan. General Yahya Khan, who took over as president after Ayub's resignation, promised to hold free and fair elections to transfer power to elected representatives. These elections were seen as a chance to address the grievances of East Pakistanis, who had long been marginalized politically, economically, and culturally.

### **Parties and Leaders**
The election featured two dominant political parties, one from each wing of Pakistan:

1. **Awami League (East Pakistan)**  
   - Led by **Sheikh Mujibur Rahman**, the Awami League emerged as the voice of East Pakistan's aspirations for autonomy and justice.  
   - Campaigning on the **6-Point Program**, the party sought greater provincial autonomy, economic fairness, and recognition of East Pakistan's rights within a federal framework.

2. **Pakistan Peoples Party (West Pakistan)**  
   - Founded by **Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto**, the PPP appealed to the working class and rural populations in West Pakistan with slogans like "Roti, Kapra, Makan" (Food, Clothing, Shelter).  
   - While the PPP advocated for socialism and reform, it did not support the 6-Points or East Pakistan's demand for autonomy.

Other smaller parties also participated, but the Awami League and PPP dominated the electoral landscape.

### **Election Campaign**
The issues and promises made during the campaign highlighted the stark differences between East and West Pakistan:

- **Awami League**:  
  - Centered its campaign around the **6-Point Program**, which called for:
    1. A federal structure with autonomy for provinces.
    2. Separate fiscal and monetary policies for East and West Pakistan.
    3. Control over foreign exchange earnings and taxation by provinces.
    4. Independent defense and foreign policy decisions at the provincial level.
    5. Power to raise and maintain paramilitary forces.
    6. Right to establish trade relations with foreign countries.
  - Promised to end economic exploitation and restore dignity to East Pakistanis.

- **Pakistan Peoples Party**:  
  - Focused on socialist ideals, opposing feudalism and advocating land reforms.  
  - Did not explicitly address East Pakistan’s demands for autonomy, instead emphasizing national unity under centralized control.

The campaign underscored the growing divide between the two wings of Pakistan, with East Pakistan demanding self-governance and West Pakistan resisting decentralization.

### **Election Results**

#### **Awami League's Landslide Victory in East Pakistan**
- The Awami League won **160 out of 162 seats** allocated to East Pakistan in the National Assembly, securing an overwhelming majority.  
- This victory demonstrated the strong mandate given to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the 6-Points by the people of East Pakistan.

#### **Overall Majority for Awami League in National Assembly**
- With 160 seats, the Awami League achieved a **simple majority** in the 300-seat National Assembly, making it the largest party in Pakistan.  
- This meant that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had the right to form the government and become the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

#### **PPP's Majority in West Pakistan**
- In contrast, the Pakistan Peoples Party won **81 out of 138 seats** allocated to West Pakistan, emerging as the dominant force in that region.  
- However, the PPP lacked the numbers to challenge the Awami League’s overall majority.

### **Significance**

1. **Clear Mandate for the Awami League and the 6-Points**  
   - The election results were a resounding endorsement of the Awami League’s vision for a decentralized, federated Pakistan based on the 6-Points.  
   - For the first time, East Pakistanis had a legitimate claim to govern the entire country.

2. **Demonstration of Political Will**  
   - The election showed that the people of East Pakistan were united in their desire for autonomy and equality.  
   - It validated the decades-long struggle against West Pakistani domination.

3. **Political Deadlock and Refusal to Accept Results**  
   - Despite the Awami League’s majority, the West Pakistani establishment, led by President Yahya Khan and supported by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, refused to transfer power.  
   - Bhutto demanded a coalition government, arguing that no single party should form the government without representation from both wings.

4. **Escalation Toward Crisis**  
   - The refusal to honor the election results created a constitutional impasse.  
   - Talks between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Yahya Khan, and Bhutto failed to resolve the deadlock, leading to increased tensions.  
   - This ultimately culminated in the brutal crackdown known as **Operation Searchlight** in March 1971, sparking the **Bangladesh Liberation War**.

### **Conclusion**

The **General Election of 1970** was a turning point in the history of Pakistan and East Pakistan. While it provided a clear democratic mandate for the Awami League and the 6-Points, the unwillingness of the West Pakistani leadership to accept the results exposed the irreconcilable differences between the two regions. The election thus set the stage for the liberation struggle that would lead to the birth of Bangladesh in December 1971.

**Final Answer:**  
The **General Election of 1970** resulted in a decisive victory for the Awami League in East Pakistan, granting it a majority in the National Assembly. However, the refusal of West Pakistani leaders to accept these results led to a political deadlock, escalating into the Bangladesh Liberation War and the eventual emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation.
