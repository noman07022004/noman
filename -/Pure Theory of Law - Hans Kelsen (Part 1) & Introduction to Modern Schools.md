### **Pure Theory of Law: Hans Kelsen (Part 1) & Introduction to Modern Schools**

---

### **1. Hans Kelsen - Pure Theory of Law**

#### **Purity of Law**:
- **Hans Kelsen** (1881–1973) aimed to develop a **"pure" theory of law**, free from extraneous influences such as sociology, morality, politics, or psychology.
  - Kelsen sought to study law as an autonomous system of norms, focusing solely on its structure and function without reference to external factors.
  - This "purity" allows for a scientific understanding of law, treating it as an objective phenomenon rather than a subjective or moral construct.

#### **Hierarchy of Norms (Grundnorm)**:
- Kelsen introduced the concept of a **hierarchy of legal norms**, where laws are organized in a structured system with higher norms validating lower ones.
  - At the top of this hierarchy lies the **Grundnorm** (basic norm), which serves as the ultimate source of validity for the entire legal system.
  - The Grundnorm is a hypothetical foundation that cannot be derived from any higher authority but is presupposed to give coherence to the legal order.
  - Example: In a constitutional democracy, the constitution acts as the Grundnorm, providing the basis for all other laws.

#### **Validity vs. Effectiveness**:
- Kelsen distinguishes between **legal validity** and **effectiveness**:
  - **Validity**: A law is valid if it conforms to the hierarchical structure of norms and derives its authority from the Grundnorm, regardless of whether it is obeyed or enforced.
  - **Effectiveness**: A law is effective if it is actually followed and enforced in practice.
  - While effectiveness may influence the stability of a legal system, it does not determine validity. A law can be valid even if it is not widely accepted or enforced.

#### **Law as a System of Norms**:
- For Kelsen, law is fundamentally a **system of norms**—prescriptive statements that dictate how individuals ought to behave.
  - These norms are interconnected and derive their authority from higher norms, ultimately tracing back to the Grundnorm.
  - This approach emphasizes the logical and structural coherence of the legal system, independent of its social or moral context.

### **2. Introduction to Modern Schools (Brief Overview)**

#### **Modern Positivism (HLA Hart)**:
- **HLA Hart** critiqued earlier positivist theories, particularly Austin’s command theory, for oversimplifying the nature of law.
- Hart introduced the concept of **rules** as central to legal systems:
  - **Primary Rules**: Obligatory rules that impose duties on individuals (e.g., prohibitions against theft).
  - **Secondary Rules**: Rules that provide mechanisms for creating, modifying, or adjudicating primary rules (e.g., legislative processes, judicial interpretation).
- Hart’s framework emphasizes the complexity and adaptability of modern legal systems.

#### **Modern Natural Law (Fuller, Finnis)**:
- In the 20th century, natural law experienced a revival in response to positivism.
  - **Lon L. Fuller** argued that law must meet certain procedural principles (e.g., clarity, consistency) to qualify as genuine law, linking legality to morality.
  - **John Finnis** emphasized substantive moral values, identifying basic goods (e.g., life, knowledge, friendship) as the foundation of justice and human flourishing.

#### **Law as Interpretation (Dworkin)**:
- **Ronald Dworkin** critiqued positivism for failing to account for the interpretive nature of law.
  - Dworkin argued that judges do not merely apply rules but interpret legal principles in light of moral and ethical considerations.
  - His theory emphasizes the role of principles, rights, and coherence in adjudication.

#### **Sociology and Law (Weber, Marx)**:
- Sociological approaches examine law as a social institution shaped by historical, economic, and cultural forces.
  - **Max Weber** analyzed law as a form of rational authority, reflecting societal structures and values.
  - **Karl Marx** viewed law as a tool of class domination, serving the interests of the ruling class and perpetuating inequality.

#### **Critical Legal Studies and Feminist Theory**:
- **Critical Legal Studies (CLS)** challenges traditional legal doctrines, arguing that law reflects and reinforces power imbalances in society.
- **Feminist Legal Theory** critiques patriarchy and gender biases in law, advocating for reforms to promote equality and justice for women.

### **Summary**

1. **Kelsen’s Pure Theory of Law**:
   - Kelsen aimed to create a "pure" theory of law, focusing on law as a system of norms free from external influences.
   - He introduced the hierarchy of norms, with the Grundnorm as the ultimate source of validity.
   - Validity is distinct from effectiveness; a law can be valid even if it is not socially accepted or enforced.

2. **Introduction to Modern Schools**:
   - **Modern Positivism (Hart)**: Emphasizes primary and secondary rules.
   - **Modern Natural Law (Fuller, Finnis)**: Links law to procedural and substantive moral principles.
   - **Law as Interpretation (Dworkin)**: Focuses on interpretive reasoning and principles.
   - **Sociology and Law (Weber, Marx)**: Examines law as a social and economic institution.
   - **Critical Legal Studies and Feminist Theory**: Critiques power dynamics and gender biases in law.

### **Boxed Final Answer**

{
Kelsen's pure theory of law focuses on law as a system of norms, free from external influences, with the Grundnorm as the ultimate source of validity. Validity is distinct from effectiveness. Modern schools include Hart's positivism, Fuller and Finnis's natural law revival, Dworkin's interpretive theory, sociological approaches (Weber, Marx), and critical perspectives like CLS and feminist theory.
