The partition of Bengal in 1905 is a **pivotal moment** in the rise of Bengali nationalism. Let's delve into the details:

### Background to Partition:

In the early 20th century, Bengal was a massive province under British rule. It encompassed present-day West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bangladesh. This vastness made administration challenging. Simultaneously, a strong sense of Bengali identity and nationalism was emerging. Educated Bengalis were increasingly aware of their distinct language, culture, and history, and they began to actively participate in political discussions and movements.

### Reasons for Partition (Officially Stated):

The British government, under Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, officially stated that the partition was necessary for **better administration**. They argued that the sheer size of Bengal made it difficult to govern effectively. Dividing the province would lead to improved efficiency and allow for focused development in the eastern regions, which they claimed were neglected.

### Real Reasons (Underlying Motives):

While administrative convenience was cited, the underlying motives for the partition were largely political:

- **Divide and Rule:** The British aimed to weaken the growing Bengali nationalist movement. By dividing the province, they hoped to split the Bengali population along religious lines and reduce their political influence. A unified Bengal posed a significant challenge to British authority.
- **Communal Angle:** The partition plan deliberately created a Muslim-majority province in East Bengal. This was intended to appease some Muslim leaders who felt marginalized in a Hindu-dominated Bengal and potentially create a political counterweight to the nationalist movement, which had a strong Hindu base.

### Areas Partitioned:

The partition, which came into effect on October 16, 1905, divided Bengal into two new provinces:

- **East Bengal and Assam:** This province comprised the eastern districts of Bengal, including Dhaka, Chittagong, and Rajshahi, along with the province of Assam. It had a Muslim-majority population.
- **West Bengal:** This province consisted of the western districts of Bengal, including Calcutta, and had a Hindu-majority population.

### Bengali Response to Partition:

The announcement and implementation of the partition triggered **widespread outrage** among Bengalis. They saw it as a deliberate attempt to divide their homeland and suppress their nationalist aspirations. Public meetings, protests, and demonstrations erupted across Bengal. The day the partition came into effect was observed as a day of mourning.

### Swadeshi Movement:

The partition became the catalyst for the **Swadeshi movement**, a powerful expression of Bengali nationalism and a significant phase in India's independence struggle. Key aspects of this movement were:

- **Boycott of British Goods:** Bengalis actively boycotted British-made goods, such as textiles, sugar, and salt. This was an economic strategy to hurt British businesses and demonstrate their opposition to the partition. _“Burn foreign cloth!”_ became a popular slogan.
- **Promotion of Indigenous Goods:** The Swadeshi movement emphasized the use of locally produced goods. People were encouraged to buy and use Indian products, fostering a sense of self-reliance and boosting the Indian economy. This led to the establishment of many indigenous industries and businesses.
- **Mass Mobilization:** The movement involved people from all sections of society, including students, women, and peasants. It fostered political awareness and participation on a large scale. Patriotic songs, plays, and literature played a crucial role in mobilizing the masses.
- **Growth of Bengali Identity:** The partition and the subsequent Swadeshi movement significantly strengthened Bengali cultural and political identity. It fostered a sense of unity and collective purpose among Bengalis, transcending religious and social divisions, at least initially.

### Long-term Impact:

Despite being annulled in 1911 due to intense and sustained pressure from the nationalist movement, the partition of Bengal in 1905 was a **pivotal event**. It **galvanized Bengali nationalism** and played a crucial role in the broader Indian independence movement. It demonstrated the power of mass mobilization and the determination of the Indian people to resist British rule. The seeds of Bengali identity, nurtured during this period, continued to grow and eventually contributed to the creation of an independent Bangladesh in 1971.
