### **Operation Searchlight (March 25-26, 1971)**

#### **Pakistani Military Planning and Objectives**
Operation Searchlight was a meticulously planned military operation by the Pakistan Army aimed at suppressing the Bengali nationalist movement in East Pakistan. Its objectives included:
1. Neutralizing the leadership of the Awami League and other pro-independence forces.
2. Disarming Bengali members of the armed forces and paramilitary units.
3. Crushing resistance from students, intellectuals, and civilians who supported the independence movement.
4. Establishing control over key cities, communication hubs, and infrastructure in East Pakistan.

The operation was intended to be swift and decisive, with the expectation that overwhelming force would quell any rebellion. However, it instead ignited widespread resistance and laid the groundwork for the Liberation War.
