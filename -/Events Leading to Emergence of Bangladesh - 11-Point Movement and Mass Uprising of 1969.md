### Events Leading to the Emergence of Bangladesh: 11-Point Movement and Mass Uprising of 1969

The emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation in 1971 was a culmination of decades of political, economic, and social struggles. Two pivotal events that galvanized East Pakistan’s movement toward independence were the **11-Point Movement (1969)** and the **Mass Uprising of 1969**. These events not only highlighted the deep discontent among the people but also laid the groundwork for the eventual liberation struggle.

### **11-Point Movement (1969)**

#### **Origin and Leadership**
The 11-Point Movement was primarily led by student organizations in East Pakistan, most notably the **Chhatra League**, the student wing of the Awami League. This movement emerged as a response to the growing economic disparity, political repression, and cultural marginalization faced by East Pakistan under the central government dominated by West Pakistan. It served as an extension of the broader demand for autonomy articulated in the **6-Point Movement** led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

#### **Demands (Key Points)**
The 11-Point Movement expanded upon the 6-Point demands, incorporating additional socio-economic and educational grievances specific to students and working-class communities. The key demands included:
1. Recognition of Bengali as one of the state languages.
2. Autonomy for East Pakistan based on the 6-Point Program.
3. Removal of disparities between East and West Pakistan in terms of resource allocation.
4. Nationalization of banks and major industries to reduce economic inequality.
5. Implementation of land reforms to address rural poverty.
6. Free education up to the university level.
7. Lowering of the voting age to 18 years.
8. Freedom of the press and protection of civil liberties.
9. Elimination of corruption and nepotism.
10. Release of all political prisoners.
11. Withdrawal of the Agartala Conspiracy Case against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and other accused individuals.

These demands reflected a broad-based agenda that sought not only political autonomy but also social justice and economic equality.

#### **Support Base**
The 11-Point Movement gained widespread support across East Pakistan. Its appeal transcended students and intellectuals, attracting laborers, peasants, and middle-class professionals. The inclusivity of its demands made it a unifying platform for various sections of society, fostering a sense of collective identity and purpose among Bengalis.

### **Mass Uprising of 1969 (গণঅভ্যুত্থান)**

#### **Trigger**
The immediate trigger for the Mass Uprising of 1969 was the **Agartala Conspiracy Case**, in which Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 34 others were arrested on charges of conspiring with India to secede East Pakistan. This case was widely seen as politically motivated and became a rallying point for opposition groups. Additionally, the authoritarian rule of President Ayub Khan, marked by repression, rigged elections, and economic exploitation of East Pakistan, fueled public anger.

#### **Nature of the Uprising**
The uprising took the form of widespread protests, strikes, demonstrations, and civil disobedience. Students played a central role in organizing rallies, sit-ins, and processions, often facing brutal crackdowns by security forces. The unrest spread rapidly across cities and towns in East Pakistan, paralyzing daily life and challenging the legitimacy of the regime.

#### **Student and Public Participation**
Students were at the forefront of the movement, with universities becoming hotbeds of activism. Institutions like Dhaka University became epicenters of resistance, where young activists demanded freedom and justice. The general public, including workers, farmers, and urban dwellers, joined hands with students, amplifying the scale and impact of the protests. The slogan **"Assault! Finish Him!" (আস্সাল্ট করো, শেষ করো!)** echoed through the streets as demonstrators called for the ouster of Ayub Khan.

#### **Fall of Ayub Khan Regime**
The relentless pressure from the Mass Uprising forced President Ayub Khan to step down in March 1969. He handed over power to General Yahya Khan, marking the end of his decade-long military dictatorship. Although the transfer of power did not bring immediate resolution to East Pakistan's grievances, it symbolized a significant victory for the people’s movement.

#### **Significance**
The Mass Uprising of 1969 had profound implications:
1. **Release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman**: One of the key outcomes was the withdrawal of the Agartala Conspiracy Case and the release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who emerged as a national hero.
2. **Empowerment of the People**: The uprising demonstrated the immense power of collective action and set a precedent for future movements.
3. **Preparation for Elections**: By exposing the vulnerabilities of the Pakistani state, the uprising paved the way for the landmark 1970 general elections, in which the Awami League won a decisive mandate on the basis of the 6-Point Program.
4. **Catalyst for Liberation**: The events of 1969 solidified the resolve of East Pakistanis to pursue self-determination, ultimately leading to the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.
