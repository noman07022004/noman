- The structure of words
	- Simple words
		- Words that can't be divided into smaller meaningful segments are called simple words.
		- And, the, if, on etc.
	- Composite words
		- Words that have recognizable internal structures and can be divided into smaller meaningful segments are called composite words.
		- Unhappy = un + happy
		- unwell, uncover, undress, unlock.
	- Affix
		- An affix is a part of a word that is added to a base word to change its meaning or grammatical function.
		- unhappily = un + happy + ly
		- If the affix comes at the beginning, it is called **prefix**.
			- unhappy = un + happy
		- If it comes at the end, it is suffix.
			- happily = happy + ly

- Sources of new words and meanings
	- Borrowings and existing resources
		- A major source of new words in our language, specially in earlier periods, is the acceptance of words from other languages.
		- perestroika and glasnost from Russian.
		- bimbo and galleria from Italian
		- intifada and fatwa from Arabic
		- Karaoke and futon from Japanese
		- fromagefrais from French
		- Yuppie, fax, headhunt, and safe sex from united states' English
		- wheelie-bin and go walkabout from Australian expressions
		- Our vocabulary has increased by adding new meanings to existing words or expression
			- menu for a set of options in a computer program
			- paste for a computer process of transferring text
- Main Types of Word-Formation
	- Present day, English has four main processes that result in the formation of new words.
	- prefixation
		- the addition of a prefix in from of a base
			- pro-life, recycle, deselect
		- prefixation is class-maintaining in that it retains the word class of the base.
			- noun choice > noun pro-choice
			- adjective green > adjective ungreen
			- verb select > verb deselect
		- There are exceptions
			- adjective sure > verb ensure
			- noun mask > verb unmask
			- noun friend > verb befriend
	- suffixation
		- the addition of a suffix at the end of a base
			- ageism, marginalize, additive
		- Suffixation tends to be class-changing.
			- adjective fat > noun fattism
			- verb lug > adjective luggable
			- verb highlight > noun highlighter
		- there are exceptions
			- noun martyr > noun martyrdom
			- noun author > noun authorships
			- Though there is a shift in subclass from concrete noun to abstract noun
			- noun host > noun hostess
			- adjective kind > adjective kindly
			- adjective economic > adjective economical
	- compounding
		- the combination of two or more bases
			- hands-on, helpline, spin doctor
			- red-handed
			- user-friendly
			- user-friendliness
			- necklace
			- reader-friendly/ reader-friendlier/ reader-friendliest
			- headhunt/ headhunts/ headhunted/ headhunting
			- marginalize/ marginalizes/ marginalized/ marginalizing
	- conversion
		- the change of a base from one word class to another without any change in form
			- the verbs email, fax, and microwave derive from the nouns of the same form.
- Combining form
	- Combining forms are segments that do not occur as separate words in the language and like affixes they are attached before or after another segment to constitute a word.
	- They are usually neo-classical; that is to say, they are mostly segments originating from Latin and Greek that are used to form words in English
	- Example of initial combining forms
		- Anglo
		- astro
		- bio
		- electro
		- euro
		- psycho
		- tele
	- examples of final combining forms
		- cide
		- cracy
		- gram
		- graph
		- logy
		- phile
		- phobe
	- There may be combined with established English words
		- biochemistry
		- electromagnetism
		- psychotherapy
		- eurosceptic
		- teleconference
		- meritocracy
		- futurology
		- escapologist
	- combining forms are a common feature of scientific terminology, particularly in chemistry and pharmacology.
	- Initial combining forms generally end in a vowel, mostly o. though other vowels are also found,
		- agriculture
		- docudrama
	- when a new initial combining form is created, it tends to end in o. It may be shortened for that purpose from a longer word:
		- eco from ecology and ecological
			- ecosystem
			- ecocentric
		- Euro from Europe and European
			- Eurocrat
			- Eurospeak
	- If that possibility is not available, the combining vowel o is added to convert the first segment into a combining form
		- speedometer
		- futurology
		- meritocracy
		- francophone
	- two combining forms can be joined to form a word
		- psychology
		- homophobe
		- Eurocrat
		- astronaut
	- final combining forms regularly combine only with initial combining forms *logo*, requires an initial combining form such as psycho, socio, anthropo, futuro, escapo
	- pigeoncide is irregular, though intelligible, as would be spacenautin place of astronaut.
