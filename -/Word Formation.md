- The structure of words
	- Simple words
		- Words that can't be divided into smaller meaningful segments are called simple words.
		- And, the, if, on etc.
	- Composite words
		- Words that have recognizable internal structures and can be divided into smaller meaningful segments are called composite words.
		- Unhappy = un + happy
		- unwell, uncover, undress, unlock.
	- Affix
		- An affix is a part of a word that is added to a base word to change its meaning or grammatical function.
		- unhappily = un + happy + ly
		- If the affix comes at the beginning, it is called **prefix**.
			- unhappy = un + happy
		- If it comes at the end, it is suffix.
			- happily = happy + ly

- Sources of new words and meanings
	- Borrowings and existing resources
		- A major source of new words in our language, specially in earlier periods, is the acceptance of words from other languages.
		- perestroika and glasnost from Russian.
		- bimbo and galleria from Italian
		- intifada and fatwa from Arabic
		- Karaoke and futon from Japanese
		- fromagefrais from French
		- Yuppie, fax, headhunt, and safe sex from united states' English
		- wheelie-bin and go walkabout from Australian expressions
		- Our vocabulary has increased by adding new meanings to existing words or expression
			- menu for a set of options in a computer program
			- paste for a computer process of transferring text
- Main Types of Word-Formation
	- Present day, English has four main processes that result in the formation of new words.
	- prefixation
		- the addition of a prefix in from of a base
			- pro-life, recycle, deselect
		- prefixation is class-maintaining in that it retains the word class of the base.
			- noun choice > noun pro-choice
			- adjective green > adjective ungreen
			- verb select > verb deselect
		- There are exceptions
			- adjective sure > verb ensure
			- noun mask > verb unmask
			- noun friend > verb befriend
	- suffixation
		- the addition of a suffix at the end of a base
			- ageism, marginalize, additive
		- Suffixation tends to be class-changing.
			- adjective fat > noun fattism
			- verb lug > adjective luggable
			- verb highlight > noun highlighter
		- there are exceptions
			- noun martyr > noun martyrdom
			- noun author > noun authorships
			- Though there is a shift in subclass from concrete noun to abstract noun
			- noun host > noun hostess
			- adjective kind > adjective kindly
			- adjective economic > adjective economical
	- compounding
		- the combination of two or more bases
			- hands-on, helpline, spin doctor
			- red-handed
			- user-friendly
			- user-friendliness
			- necklace
			- reader-friendly/ reader-friendlier/ reader-friendliest
			- headhunt/ headhunts/ headhunted/ headhunting
			- marginalize/ marginalizes/ marginalized/ marginalizing
	- conversion
		- the change of a base from one word class to another without any change in form
			- the verbs email, fax, and microwave derive from the nouns of the same form.
- Combining form
	- Combining forms are segments that do not occur as separate words in the language and like affixes they are attached before or after another segment to constitute a word.
	- They are usually neo-classical; that is to say, they are mostly segments originating from Latin and Greek that are used to form words in English
	- Example of initial combining forms
		- Anglo
		- astro
		- bio
		- electro
		- euro
		- psycho
		- tele
	- examples of final combining forms
		- cide
		- cracy
		- gram
		- graph
		- logy
		- phile
		- phobe
	- There may be combined with established English words
		- biochemistry
		- electromagnetism
		- psychotherapy
		- eurosceptic
		- teleconference
		- meritocracy
		- futurology
		- escapologist
	- combining forms are a common feature of scientific terminology, particularly in chemistry and pharmacology.
	- Initial combining forms generally end in a vowel, mostly o. though other vowels are also found,
		- agriculture
		- docudrama
	- when a new initial combining form is created, it tends to end in o. It may be shortened for that purpose from a longer word:
		- eco from ecology and ecological
			- ecosystem
			- ecocentric
		- Euro from Europe and European
			- Eurocrat
			- Eurospeak
	- If that possibility is not available, the combining vowel o is added to convert the first segment into a combining form
		- speedometer
		- futurology
		- meritocracy
		- francophone
	- two combining forms can be joined to form a word
		- psychology
		- homophobe
		- Eurocrat
		- astronaut
	- final combining forms regularly combine only with initial combining forms *logo*, requires an initial combining form such as psycho, socio, anthropo, futuro, escapo
	- pigeoncide is irregular, though intelligible, as would be spacenautin place of astronaut.
- Prefixes
	- Supportive and opposing:
		- pro - on the side of
			- pro-choice, pro-life, pro-market
		- anti
			- against, counteracting
				- antibody, anti-abortion, anticoagulant
			- spurious:
				- anti-hero, antichrist
		- contra
			- against
				- contraception, contraindicate
			- contrasting
				- contraflow, contradistinction
		- counter
			- in opposition to
				- counteract, counter-example, counter-espionage
		- pro- and anti- are the most common prefixes in this set and are antonyms. They can be freely used with nouns and adjectives to express support or opposition.
	- Reversative and deprivative
		- de
			- reverse of something
				- decriminalize, deselect, decontaminate
			- remove something
				- debug, defrost, delouse
			- depart from or cause to depart from
				- deplane, detrain, decamp
		- dis
			- reverse of something
				- disqualify, disinvite, disenfranchise
			- remove something
				- disarm, disillusion, disambiguate
		- un
			- reverse of something
				- unscramble, untie, unlock
			- remove something
				-  unleaded, unmask, unhouse
		- The reversative sense may be illustrated by decriminalize, which denotes the act of undoing the previous act of making something criminal.
		- Debug has a deprivative sense. It means to remove bugs. The departure sense of the prefix de- is rarely used to form new words
		- A creative use of reversative un- appeared in the headlines Vietnam unblackballed.
		- The antonyms of these prefixed words are mostly the corresponding unprefixed words: disarm/arm, unleaded/leaded.
		- In the departure sense, the corresponding antonyms (Where they exist) have the prefix en- or (before bases beginning with b or p) em-: decamp/encamp, deplane/ emplane.
	- Negative
		- a-
			- not
				- atheist, asymmentric
			- not affected by
				- amoral, apolitical, asexual
		- dis-
			- not
				- disloyal, distrust, disagree
		- in, il, im, ir-
			- not
				- illegal, incapable, imperfect, irregular
			- absence of
				- intolerance, impatience, injustice
		- non-
			- not
				- non-aggression, non-interference, non-stop
		- un-
			- not
				- unfair, unproductive
		- The antonyms are the corresponding unprefixed words. There are some interesting sets of related words that illustrate differences between these negative prefixes. 
		- Both amoral and immoral are antonyms of moral, but in careful usage amoral refers to behavior to which stands of morality can't be applied (for example, the behavior of animals, which are assumed not to have a moral code.)
		- Non-American is a neutral descriptive term, whereas un-Americal denotes behavior that is judged not to conform to assumed American norms.
		- Non-scientific is neutral ('not connected with science') and unscientific is evaluative ('not conforming to scientific standards of investigation').
		- In- and dis- are generally found in words of Latin or French origin.
		- Un- and non- are the two regular negative prefixes for new words.
		- Inflammable is derived from inflame, where in- is a causative prefix, and means 'capable of being set on fire.'
		- Because confusion with the negative prefix could be dangerous, it has usually been replaced on substances and manufactured objects by flammable, the negative ('Not capable of being set on fire') being noon-flammable or non-inflammable.
		- Irregardless has two negative affixes, the prefix ir- and the suffix -less. Since regardless is well-established in the language, objections have been voiced against irregardless, which is intended to have the same meaning but has the redundant prefix.
	- Pejorative
		- crypto-
			- concealed
				- crypto-fascist, crypto-Catholic, cryptography
		- mal-
			- improper
				- malpractice, malformation, malnutrition

		- Words formed with the prefixes crypto- and pseudo- can contrast neatly. 
		- A crypto-Catholic is a Catholic who conceals his religious affiliation.
		- A pseudo-Catholic is a non-Catholic who pretends to be a Catholic.
		- Disinformation has a more restricted meaning than misinformation; it refers to the intentional spreading of false or distorted information, usually by governmental agencies and particularly by intelligence agencies.

		- some of these prefixes have metaphorical extensions of their literal meanings of relative place, indicating relative status or relative intensification. Others indicate time as well as place.

			- extramural/ intramural. 
			- international/ intranational,

			- teleconference (conference where participants are linked by telecommunication devices)
			- teleprinter (printer for telegraph messages)
		- The adverb overly is an alternative to the prefix over- in its 'excessively' sense, particularly in American and Scottish usage. It premodifies adjectives:

			- miniskirt, midiskirt, maxiskirt, 
		- these have been shortened to the words
			- mini-, midi-, maxi-, micro- and macro-
		- from pairs of antonyms: 
			- microcosm/ macrocosm, 
			- macroeconomics/ microeconomics,
			- micro-scopic/ macroscopic;
		- micro and macro are themselves used as words in computer language

			- foreordain/ pre-ordain are synonyms.
	- Status

		- mono-, poly-, hemi-, and di- are generally confined nowadays to forming new words in scientific discourse. Exceptions are monophonic in contrast with stereophonic, usually abbreviated to mono and stereo, and polytechnic, which in reference toa type of british college was abbreviated to poly (but since 1992 these have assumed the title of university). 
		- Neither demi- nor duo- are productive prefixes. 
		- For non-scientific language, the productive prefixes in this list are uni-, multi-, and semi-. Curiously, unisex does not refer to one sex but to either sex.
		- We find contrasting pairs in monogamy/ polygamy, monotheism/ polytheism, monosyllabici polysyllabic, monolingual/ bilingual.

		- Words prefixed by bi- that refer to time frequency may be ambiguous; for example. 
			- biweekly or bimonthly may be taken to mean 'every two' or 'twice in one'. 
		- It is safe to use paraphrase:
			- every two weeks
			- twice a week
		- Bicentenary and bicentennial are unambiguously 'two hundredth'.
	- Class-changing
		- Two prefixes have as their primary effect the change of the word class. They are rarely used nowadays to form new words:
		- be-
			- for transitive verbs from nouns
				- besiege, beguile, bewitch
			- intensifying the force of verbs
				- besmear, bewail, bespatter
			- for transitive verbs from adjectives
