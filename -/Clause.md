A **clause** is a group of words that contains both a **subject** and a **verb**. Clauses are the building blocks of sentences, and they can be either **independent** (able to stand alone as a complete sentence) or **dependent** (unable to stand alone and needing additional information to form a complete thought).

Let’s break down everything you need to know about clauses step by step:

---

### 1. **What Is a Clause?**
A clause consists of:
- A **subject**: The person, place, thing, or idea performing the action.
- A **verb**: The action or state of being.

For example:
- "She **runs** every morning."
  - Subject: "She"
  - Verb: "runs"

Clauses differ from **phrases**, which do not contain both a subject and a verb.

### 2. **Types of Clauses**
Clauses are categorized into two main types based on their ability to stand alone as a complete sentence:

#### a) **Independent Clause**
An independent clause expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence.

- Example: "I went to the store."
  - Subject: "I"
  - Verb: "went"

Since it conveys a full idea, it does not require additional information.

#### b) **Dependent Clause**
A dependent clause (also called a subordinate clause) does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone. It relies on an independent clause to complete its meaning.

- Example: "Because I was tired..."
  - Subject: "I"
  - Verb: "was"
  - This clause needs more information to make sense.

### 3. **Functions of Dependent Clauses**
Dependent clauses often begin with subordinating conjunctions or relative pronouns. They serve specific functions in a sentence:

#### a) **Adverbial Clauses**
These modify verbs and answer questions like **when**, **where**, **why**, **how**, or **under what conditions**.

- Subordinating Conjunctions: "because," "although," "since," "if," "when," "while"
- Example: "I stayed home **because it was raining**."
  - Function: Explains the reason for staying home.

#### b) **Adjectival Clauses (Relative Clauses)**
These modify nouns and provide additional information about them. They often begin with relative pronouns like "who," "whom," "whose," "which," or "that."

- Example: "The book **that I borrowed** is interesting."
  - Function: Describes "the book."

#### c) **Noun Clauses**
These function as nouns within a sentence and can act as subjects, objects, or complements.

- Example: "**What she said** surprised me."
  - Function: Acts as the subject of the sentence.

---

### 4. **Combining Clauses**
Sentences often combine independent and dependent clauses to create more complex structures. Here are some common ways clauses are combined:

#### a) **Compound Sentences**
Two or more independent clauses are joined by a coordinating conjunction (**for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so**) or a semicolon.

- Example: "I wanted to go for a walk, **but it started raining**."

#### b) **Complex Sentences**
One independent clause is combined with one or more dependent clauses.

- Example: "I stayed home **because it was raining**."

#### c) **Compound-Complex Sentences**
These include at least two independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.

- Example: "I wanted to go for a walk, **but it started raining**, so I stayed home instead."

---

### 5. **Common Mistakes with Clauses**
Here are some frequent errors to avoid when working with clauses:

#### a) **Run-On Sentences**
Failing to properly connect independent clauses can result in run-on sentences.
- Incorrect: "I went to the store I bought milk."
  - Correct: "I went to the store, and I bought milk."

#### b) **Sentence Fragments**
Using a dependent clause alone creates a sentence fragment.
- Incorrect: "Because I was tired."
  - Correct: "Because I was tired, I went to bed early."

#### c) **Misusing Subordinating Conjunctions**
Ensure that subordinating conjunctions are used correctly to introduce dependent clauses.
- Incorrect: "I stayed home, because it was raining."
  - Correct: "I stayed home because it was raining." (No comma needed here.)

### 6. **Why Are Clauses Important?**
Clauses are essential for constructing clear and varied sentences. By combining independent and dependent clauses, you can add depth and complexity to your writing, making it more engaging and precise.

---

### Final Summary
A **clause** is a group of words containing a subject and a verb. There are two main types:
1. **Independent Clause**: Expresses a complete thought and can stand alone.
2. **Dependent Clause**: Does not express a complete thought and requires an independent clause.

Dependent clauses can function as adverbial, adjectival, or noun clauses. Combining clauses allows you to create compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences. Understanding clauses helps improve sentence structure and clarity.

### Practice Exercise
Identify the type of clause (independent or dependent) in each sentence and classify its function if it’s a dependent clause:

1. "I finished my homework before dinner."
2. "Because she was late, we missed the bus."
3. "The movie that we watched was amazing."
4. "He doesn’t know what she wants."
5. "We will leave if it stops raining."

---

### Answers:
1. **Independent Clause**: "I finished my homework"  
   **Dependent Clause**: "before dinner" → Adverbial (time)

2. **Dependent Clause**: "Because she was late" → Adverbial (reason)  
   **Independent Clause**: "we missed the bus"

3. **Independent Clause**: "The movie was amazing"  
   **Dependent Clause**: "that we watched" → Adjectival (modifies "movie")

4. **Independent Clause**: "He doesn’t know"  
   **Dependent Clause**: "what she wants" → Noun (acts as the object of "know")

5. **Independent Clause**: "We will leave"  
   **Dependent Clause**: "if it stops raining" → Adverbial (condition)
