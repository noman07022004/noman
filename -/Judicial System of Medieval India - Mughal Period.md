The Mughal judicial system represents a significant phase in the legal history of India. It built upon earlier systems, particularly that of the Delhi Sultanate, and established a framework that, while rooted in Islamic law, also adapted to the diverse realities of the Indian subcontinent.  

#### Continuity and Development from Sultanate

The Mughal judicial system **largely continued the framework established by the Delhi Sultanate**, particularly in its reliance on Islamic law and the presence of key judicial officials like the Qazi. However, the Mughals brought about certain refinements and a greater centralization of authority.

- **Continuity:** The fundamental structure of having Qazis to administer justice based on Islamic law persisted. The concept of the ruler as the ultimate source of justice also carried over.  
    
- **Development:** The Mughals saw a more defined hierarchy of courts and officials. The role of the Emperor in directly overseeing and intervening in judicial matters became more pronounced. Emperors like Akbar attempted to create a more unified legal system, even while respecting local customs. The Mughal administration also became more sophisticated, leading to better record-keeping and potentially a more organized judicial process in some areas.  
    

#### Emperor as Supreme Judge

The **Emperor held the highest position in the judicial system**. He was considered the ultimate source of justice and had the power to hear appeals, issue decrees, and even directly intervene in cases.  

- The Emperor often held court regularly to hear petitions and dispense justice. This practice was particularly emphasized by emperors like Jahangir, who famously had a _'chain of justice'_ installed in Agra Fort, allowing anyone to directly petition him.  
    
- The Emperor's decisions set precedents and influenced the administration of justice throughout the empire. His personal interest and involvement could significantly impact the fairness and efficiency of the system.

#### Judicial Officials (Qazis, Mir Adls, Muftis)

A hierarchy of judicial officials assisted the Emperor in administering justice:  

- **Qazi:** The **Qazi was the primary judicial officer** at various levels. Appointed by the state, their main function was to administer justice according to Islamic law (Sharia), primarily based on the Hanafi school. There were Qazis in towns and cities, and a **Chief Qazi (Qazi-ul-Quzat or Sadr)** at the imperial level who oversaw all other Qazis. They adjudicated civil and criminal cases based on Islamic legal principles.  
    
- **Mir Adl:** The **Mir Adl was specifically responsible for dispensing justice fairly**. In some instances, particularly at higher levels, the roles of the Qazi and Mir Adl might overlap or be held by the same person. However, the Mir Adl's focus was more on the equitable application of the law.
- **Mufti:** The **Mufti was a legal expert who interpreted Islamic law and provided opinions (fatwas)** on legal matters. Qazis often consulted Muftis to clarify points of law before delivering judgments.  
    

#### Court Hierarchy (Village Panchayats, Qazi Courts in Towns, Imperial Courts)

The Mughal judicial system operated on a tiered structure:

- **Village Panchayats:** At the **village level, disputes were often resolved by traditional Village Panchayats** (councils of elders). These bodies dealt with minor civil and social disputes based on local customs and traditions. Their decisions were generally accepted by the community.  
    
- **Qazi Courts in Towns:** In **towns and cities, Qazi courts were the primary judicial institutions**. These courts, presided over by the appointed Qazis, dealt with a wider range of civil and criminal cases based on Islamic law.
- **Imperial Courts:** At the **highest level were the Imperial Courts**, presided over by the Emperor himself or by high-ranking officials acting on his behalf. These courts served as courts of appeal and dealt with important cases that had implications for the entire empire. The Chief Qazi also held a significant court at the imperial level.  
    

#### Islamic Law as Dominant System with Local Adaptations

The **Mughal legal system was primarily based on Islamic law (Sharia), specifically the Hanafi school**. However, the Mughals were pragmatic rulers and recognized the need to accommodate the diverse customs and traditions prevalent in India.  

- **Islamic Law:** In matters concerning Muslims, Islamic law was generally applied in its pure form. This included laws related to marriage, divorce, inheritance, and criminal offenses.  
    
- **Local Adaptations:** For non-Muslims, particularly Hindus, personal laws and customs were often respected and applied in matters like inheritance, marriage, and caste disputes. Village Panchayats played a crucial role in upholding these local traditions. The state generally did not interfere in these matters unless they posed a threat to public order.
- **Royal Decrees (Farman):** Emperors also issued royal decrees (_farmans_) that had the force of law and could override or supplement existing legal provisions. These decrees often addressed administrative matters or specific issues not clearly covered by Islamic law.  
    

#### Revenue and Justice Administration

**Revenue administration and justice administration were often intertwined** during Mughal rule.  

- **Officials with Dual Roles:** Many officials, such as the _Faujdar_ (a military and administrative officer at the district level), had responsibilities for both revenue collection and maintaining law and order, which included some judicial functions.  
    
- **Land Disputes:** A significant portion of judicial cases, particularly at the local level, involved land disputes, which were directly related to revenue matters. Revenue officials often played a role in resolving these disputes.
- **Financial Penalties:** Fines and confiscations were common forms of punishment, directly linking judicial decisions to the state treasury.

#### Focus on key Mughal Emperors

Different Mughal emperors had varying approaches and made notable contributions to the judicial system:

- **Akbar:** Akbar is known for his policy of religious tolerance and his attempts to create a more unified administration. While Islamic law remained the basis, he showed greater respect for Hindu law and customs. He also emphasized the Emperor's role as the ultimate arbiter of justice.  
    
- **Jahangir:** Jahangir is particularly remembered for his emphasis on the direct accessibility of justice. The _'chain of justice'_ symbolized his commitment to hearing the grievances of his subjects personally.  
    
- **Aurangzeb:** Aurangzeb was a staunch follower of Islamic law and sought to implement it more rigorously throughout the empire. He commissioned the compilation of the _Fatawa-i-Alamgiri_, a comprehensive digest of Hanafi law, which served as a guide for Qazis.
