**Subject-Verb Agreement** is a fundamental rule in English grammar that ensures the verb in a sentence matches the subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, or third). This agreement is essential for grammatical correctness and clarity.

Let’s break down everything you need to know about **subject-verb agreement** step by step:

---

### 1. **What Is Subject-Verb Agreement?**
Subject-verb agreement means that the **verb** must agree with the **subject** of the sentence in terms of:
- **Number**: Singular subjects take singular verbs; plural subjects take plural verbs.
- **Person**: The verb changes form depending on whether the subject is first person ("I," "we"), second person ("you"), or third person ("he," "she," "it," "they").

For example:
- Singular: "The cat **chases** the mouse."
- Plural: "The cats **chase** the mice."

### 2. **Basic Rules for Subject-Verb Agreement**
Here are the key rules to ensure proper subject-verb agreement:

#### a) **Singular Subjects Take Singular Verbs**
- Add **-s** or **-es** to the base verb for third-person singular subjects (he, she, it).
  - Example: "She **writes** a letter."
  - Incorrect: "She write a letter."

#### b) **Plural Subjects Take Plural Verbs**
- Use the base form of the verb for plural subjects.
  - Example: "They **write** letters."
  - Incorrect: "They writes letters."

#### c) **Second Person and First Person Plural Are Always Base Form**
- For "you," "we," and plural subjects, use the base form of the verb.
  - Example: "You **like** pizza."
  - Example: "We **enjoy** the movie."

### 3. **Special Cases of Subject-Verb Agreement**
Some sentences require extra attention because of their structure. Here’s how to handle them:

#### a) **Compound Subjects**
When two or more subjects are joined by "and," they are usually plural and take a plural verb.
- Example: "John and Mary **are** friends."
- Exception: If the compound subject refers to a single entity, use a singular verb.
  - Example: "Peanut butter and jelly **is** my favorite sandwich."

#### b) **Subjects Joined by "Or" or "Nor"**
When subjects are joined by "or" or "nor," the verb agrees with the subject closest to it.
- Example: "Either the teacher or the students **are** responsible."
- Example: "Neither the students nor the teacher **is** responsible."

#### c) **Indefinite Pronouns**
Indefinite pronouns (e.g., "everyone," "someone," "none") can be singular or plural depending on context:
- Singular: "Everyone **has** finished their work."
- Plural: "Some **are** ready to leave."

#### d) **Collective Nouns**
Collective nouns (e.g., "team," "family," "group") can be singular or plural depending on whether the group acts as one unit or as individuals:
- Singular: "The team **wins** the match." (acting as one unit)
- Plural: "The team **are** arguing among themselves." (individual actions)

#### e) **Nouns That Look Plural but Are Singular**
Some nouns appear plural but are treated as singular:
- Example: "Mathematics **is** an interesting subject."
- Example: "The news **is** shocking."

#### f) **Inverted Sentences**
In sentences where the subject follows the verb (inverted word order), identify the subject to ensure agreement:
- Example: "There **is** a book on the table." (singular subject: "a book")
- Example: "There **are** some books on the table." (plural subject: "some books")

### 4. **Common Mistakes with Subject-Verb Agreement**
Here are some frequent errors to avoid:

#### a) **Ignoring the True Subject**
- Incorrect: "The list of items **are** on the table."
  - Correct: "The list of items **is** on the table." (The subject is "list," which is singular.)

#### b) **Mistaking Collective Nouns**
- Incorrect: "The family **are** happy together."
  - Correct: "The family **is** happy together." (acting as one unit)

#### c) **Misusing Indefinite Pronouns**
- Incorrect: "Everyone **have** finished their work."
  - Correct: "Everyone **has** finished their work." (singular subject)

#### d) **Adding Extra Words Between Subject and Verb**
Be careful not to let intervening phrases confuse you.
- Incorrect: "The teacher, along with her students, **were** late."
  - Correct: "The teacher, along with her students, **was** late." (The subject is "teacher," which is singular.)

#### e) **Using Singular Verbs with Plural Subjects**
- Incorrect: "The boys plays football every evening."
  - Correct: "The boys play football every evening." (plural subject)

### 5. **Why Is Subject-Verb Agreement Important?**
Proper subject-verb agreement ensures that your sentences are clear and grammatically correct. Errors in agreement can lead to confusion or make your writing seem unpolished.

---

### Final Summary
**Subject-verb agreement** ensures that the verb matches the subject in number and person. Singular subjects take singular verbs, while plural subjects take plural verbs. Special cases like compound subjects, collective nouns, and indefinite pronouns require careful attention. Mastering subject-verb agreement improves the clarity and professionalism of your communication.
