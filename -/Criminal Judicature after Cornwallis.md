### **Criminal Judicature after Cornwallis**

Lord Cornwallis's reforms in the late 18th century marked a significant turning point in the evolution of the criminal justice system under British rule. His efforts were part of broader administrative and judicial reforms aimed at enhancing efficiency, reducing corruption, and establishing a more structured and hierarchical legal framework. Below is an in-depth analysis of the key aspects of Cornwallis's criminal judicial reforms.

### **1. Lord Cornwallis's Reforms: General Context**
Lord Cornwallis (Governor-General of Bengal from 1786 to 1793) introduced sweeping reforms to address the inefficiencies and corruption that plagued the East India Company's administration. His broader objectives included:

- **Separation of Powers**: A clear demarcation between revenue collection and judicial functions to eliminate conflicts of interest.
- **Reduction of Corruption**: Curtailing the misuse of power by officials, particularly Collectors, who had previously wielded unchecked authority over both revenue and justice.
- **Centralization and Formalization**: Establishing a centralized and hierarchical judicial system to ensure consistency and accountability.

Cornwallis's reforms were guided by principles of fairness, transparency, and adherence to English legal traditions, while still accommodating local customs where necessary.

### **2. Cornwallis's Criminal Judicial Plan (circa 1790–1793)**

#### **(a) Separation of Revenue and Judicial Functions (More Complete)**
One of Cornwallis's most significant contributions was the **complete separation** of revenue and judicial functions:
- **Removal of Collectors**: District Collectors, who had previously doubled as judges, were stripped of their judicial roles.
- **Appointment of District Judges**: Dedicated District Judges were appointed to oversee both civil and criminal justice. These judges were trained professionals, ensuring greater expertise and impartiality.

This reform addressed the longstanding issue of overlapping responsibilities and reduced opportunities for exploitation by revenue officers.

#### **(b) Reorganization of Faujdari Courts**
Cornwallis restructured the **Faujdari Courts**, which handled criminal cases at the district level:
- **Presiding Officers**: The courts were now presided over by **covenanted civil servants**—Company officials trained in administration and law.
- **Improved Oversight**: The involvement of trained officials ensured better enforcement of laws and adherence to procedural norms.
- **Uniformity**: The reorganization aimed to standardize practices across districts, reducing inconsistencies in the administration of criminal justice.

This reform marked a shift away from relying on local Qazis and Muftis, though they continued to advise on matters of Muslim law.

#### **(c) Establishment of Circuit Courts (Courts of Circuit)**
Cornwallis introduced **Courts of Circuit** to handle serious criminal cases:
- **Purpose**: These courts were established in each division to try major offenses such as murder, robbery, and other grave crimes.
- **Composition**: Presided over by **two covenanted civil servants**, ensuring impartiality and collective decision-making.
- **Mobility**: Judges traveled within their division to conduct trials, bringing justice closer to rural areas and reducing delays.

The Circuit Courts played a crucial role in addressing serious crimes and ensuring timely justice.

#### **(d) Sadr Nizamat Adalat at Calcutta (Reorganized)**
The **Sadr Nizamat Adalat** was restructured as the highest appellate court for criminal cases:
- **Composition**: It was now composed of the **Governor-General and Council members**, with Qazis and Muftis serving as advisors on Muslim law.
- **Jurisdiction**: Functioned as the final appellate authority for all criminal cases originating from district-level courts.
- **Enhanced Authority**: The reorganization strengthened the court's role in overseeing criminal justice administration and ensuring uniformity.

This reform centralized appellate authority and improved the quality of oversight in criminal matters.

---

#### **(e) Law Applied in Criminal Courts**
- **Continued Application of Muslim Criminal Law**: Islamic Shariat law remained the primary basis for criminal justice, but it was modified to align with British notions of justice and equity.
- **Influence of English Legal Principles**: Over time, English legal principles began to exert a growing influence, particularly in procedural matters and the interpretation of evidence.

This hybrid approach reflected the colonial strategy of blending local customs with English legal traditions.

### **3. Significance of Cornwallis's Reforms**
Cornwallis's reforms significantly strengthened and formalized the criminal justice system under Company control. Their significance can be summarized as follows:

#### **(a) Greater Efficiency and Accountability**
- The separation of revenue and judicial functions eliminated conflicts of interest and reduced opportunities for corruption.
- Dedicated District Judges and trained civil servants ensured greater expertise and impartiality in administering justice.

#### **(b) Hierarchical and Structured System**
- The introduction of Circuit Courts and the reorganization of the Sadr Nizamat Adalat created a clear hierarchy of courts, ensuring systematic administration of justice.
- Appeals could now be heard at higher levels, providing a mechanism for redressal and reducing arbitrariness.

#### **(c) Centralization of Authority**
- The centralization of appellate authority in the Sadr Nizamat Adalat improved oversight and consistency in criminal justice administration.

#### **(d) Foundation for Modern Criminal Justice**
- Cornwallis's reforms laid the groundwork for a modern, structured criminal justice system that would evolve further in subsequent decades.
- The incorporation of English legal principles paved the way for the eventual dominance of British jurisprudence in India.

#### **(e) Limitations**
- Despite these advancements, the reforms did not fully address issues such as the exclusion of Indians from higher judicial roles or the marginalization of local customs in favor of English law.
- The reliance on covenanted civil servants also meant that justice remained largely in the hands of European officials, reinforcing colonial biases.

### **Conclusion**
Lord Cornwallis's criminal judicial reforms represented a major step forward in the development of a formal and hierarchical criminal justice system in British India. By separating revenue and judicial functions, reorganizing Faujdari Courts, establishing Circuit Courts, and restructuring the Sadr Nizamat Adalat, Cornwallis introduced a degree of order and accountability that had been lacking in earlier arrangements. While these reforms were not without limitations, they set the stage for further improvements and left a lasting impact on the administration of justice in India.

**Final Answer**: Cornwallis's reforms (circa 1790–1793) significantly strengthened the criminal justice system by separating revenue and judicial functions, reorganizing Faujdari Courts, establishing Circuit Courts, and restructuring the Sadr Nizamat Adalat. These measures created a more hierarchical, efficient, and centralized system under Company control, laying the foundation for modern criminal justice in India.
