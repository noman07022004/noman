### Events Leading to the Emergence of Bangladesh: Historical 7th March Speech

The **7th March Speech** delivered by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at the Race Course Ground (now Suhrawardy Udyan) in Dhaka is widely regarded as one of the most significant moments in the history of Bangladesh. It marked a turning point in the struggle for independence, galvanizing the people of East Pakistan and setting the stage for the Liberation War of 1971.

### **Context**
After the **General Election of 1970**, the Awami League emerged victorious with a clear majority in the National Assembly, winning on the platform of the **6-Point Program**. However, the West Pakistani establishment, led by President Yahya Khan and supported by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, refused to transfer power to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This refusal created a political deadlock, escalating tensions between East and West Pakistan. The situation worsened with the postponement of the National Assembly session scheduled for March 3, 1971, which was seen as a betrayal by the people of East Pakistan. Amidst growing unrest and anticipation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered his historic speech on March 7, 1971.

### **Key Themes and Messages of the Speech**

#### **Call for Freedom and Self-Determination**
The speech contained an implicit but unmistakable call for independence if the demands of the Awami League were not met. The most powerful line from the speech—"**এবারের সংগ্রাম আমাদের মুক্তির সংগ্রাম, এবারের সংগ্রাম স্বাধীনতার সংগ্রাম**" ("This time the struggle is for our emancipation, this time the struggle is for our independence")—resonated deeply with the audience. While Sheikh Mujibur Rahman did not explicitly declare independence, the message was clear: the people of East Pakistan were prepared to fight for their freedom.

#### **Four Conditions for Joining the National Assembly**
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman outlined four conditions that needed to be fulfilled before the Awami League would participate in the National Assembly:
1. Immediate withdrawal of martial law.
2. Withdrawal of Pakistani troops from East Pakistan.
3. Investigation into the killings of Bengalis during the Mass Uprising of 1969 and subsequent crackdowns.
4. Transfer of power to the elected representatives of the people.

These conditions were non-negotiable and underscored the Awami League’s commitment to restoring democracy and justice.

#### **Call for Non-Cooperation Movement**
The speech also served as a formal declaration of a **non-cooperation movement** against the Pakistani government. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman instructed the people to engage in civil disobedience by:
- Boycotting government institutions and services.
- Refusing to pay taxes.
- Establishing parallel governance structures led by the Awami League.

This call for non-cooperation effectively paralyzed the administrative machinery in East Pakistan, further isolating the West Pakistani regime.

#### **Preparation for Struggle**
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman urged the people to prepare for a possible armed struggle. He emphasized the need for discipline, unity, and readiness to face any challenge. His words inspired confidence and resolve among the masses, who began organizing themselves for the impending conflict.
