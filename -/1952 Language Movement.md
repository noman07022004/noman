- In 1948, **Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah** and later **Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan** declared that **Urdu** would be the **sole national language** of Pakistan.

### **2. Bengali-Speaking Majority and Growing Discontent:**

- **Bengali was spoken by over 56% of Pakistan’s population**, making it the most widely spoken language in the country.
- The imposition of Urdu was seen as an **attack on Bengali identity, culture, and political rights**.
- Discontent grew as the government of Pakistan failed to recognize Bengali in government, education, and media.
