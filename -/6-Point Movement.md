### Events Leading to the Emergence of Bangladesh: The 6-Point Movement

#### **Context: Socio-Economic and Political Grievances of East Pakistan**
The creation of Pakistan in 1947, comprising two geographically separated wings—West Pakistan and East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh)—laid the foundation for deep-seated grievances. Though united by religion, the two regions were starkly different in terms of language, culture, economy, and political priorities.

1. **Economic Disparity**: East Pakistan was one of the world’s most fertile agricultural regions but received minimal investment or benefits from its resources. Jute, the "golden fiber" produced in East Pakistan, contributed significantly to Pakistan's export earnings, yet only a fraction of the revenue was reinvested in East Pakistan's development. Industrialization and infrastructure development were heavily concentrated in West Pakistan.
   
2. **Political Marginalization**: Despite having a larger population than West Pakistan, East Pakistan was consistently underrepresented in government institutions, including the military, bureaucracy, and judiciary. Power remained centralized in West Pakistan, with little regard for East Pakistan's needs or aspirations.

3. **Cultural Suppression**: Urdu was imposed as the sole national language despite Bengali being spoken by the majority of Pakistanis. This disregard for Bengali identity sparked movements like the Language Movement of 1952, which became a symbol of resistance against cultural oppression.

Amid these grievances, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman emerged as a leader who could articulate the demands of East Pakistanis effectively.

#### **Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Awami League**
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, often referred to as "Bangabandhu" (Friend of Bengal), rose to prominence through his leadership of the Awami League, the dominant political party in East Pakistan. Under his guidance, the Awami League transformed into a platform advocating for the rights and autonomy of East Pakistanis.

Mujib's charisma and unwavering commitment to East Pakistani causes made him a unifying figure. He recognized that piecemeal reforms would not suffice; instead, structural changes were needed to address systemic exploitation. In this context, he formulated the **6-Point Program**, which became a turning point in the struggle for autonomy.

#### **6-Point Program (1966)**

##### **Formulation and Announcement**
The 6-Point Program was formulated by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and announced at a conference of opposition parties held in Lahore in February 1966. However, it gained widespread attention after Mujib presented it during an all-party meeting in Dhaka later that year. It served as a blueprint for East Pakistan's autonomy within Pakistan.

##### **Key Demands**

1. **Federal System of Government and Parliamentary Democracy**  
   - A federal structure where provinces would have substantial autonomy, and power would be decentralized.
   - Parliamentary democracy would ensure representation based on population size.

2. **Limited Federal Authority**  
   - The central government should retain control over defense and foreign affairs while delegating all other powers to the provinces.

3. **Separate Currencies or Freely Convertible Currencies**  
   - To prevent economic exploitation, East Pakistan should either have its own currency or establish freely convertible currencies between the two wings.

4. **Provincial Control Over Taxation and Revenue Collection**  
   - Provinces should collect their own taxes and retain the revenue generated, reducing dependence on transfers from the center.

5. **Separate External Trade Accounts for East Pakistan**  
   - East Pakistan should manage its own trade accounts to ensure fair distribution of export earnings and imports.

6. **Separate Militia or Paramilitary Force for East Pakistan**  
   - East Pakistan should maintain its own paramilitary force for internal security, given the region's vulnerability due to its geographical distance from West Pakistan.

##### **Rationale and Significance**
The 6 points addressed the core issues facing East Pakistan:
- **Autonomy**: By decentralizing power, the program sought to empower East Pakistan to govern itself according to its unique needs.
- **Economic Justice**: Separate fiscal and trade mechanisms aimed to end economic exploitation and ensure equitable resource allocation.
- **Security**: A separate militia underscored the need for self-reliance in safeguarding East Pakistan's interests.

These demands were seen as essential for achieving meaningful autonomy within Pakistan. If implemented, they would have fundamentally altered the relationship between East and West Pakistan, giving East Pakistan de facto independence in many spheres.

#### **Response to the 6-Points**
The reaction from the Pakistani government and West Pakistani establishment was overwhelmingly hostile. They viewed the 6-Point Program as a threat to national unity and accused Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of promoting separatism.

1. **Government Crackdown**: The Ayub Khan regime arrested Sheikh Mujib and charged him with sedition under the Agartala Conspiracy Case in 1968, alleging that he was conspiring with India to break up Pakistan.
   
2. **Public Backlash in West Pakistan**: Politicians and media outlets in West Pakistan branded the 6 points as anti-national and divisive, further polarizing public opinion.

Despite repression, the movement gained momentum, uniting diverse groups—including students, workers, and intellectuals—behind the demand for autonomy.

#### **Impact**
The 6-Point Movement marked a watershed moment in East Pakistan's history:

1. **Charter of Autonomy**: It became a rallying cry for Bengali nationalism, articulating the aspirations of millions who felt marginalized within Pakistan.

2. **Mass Mobilization**: The movement galvanized mass support across East Pakistan, strengthening the Awami League's position as the voice of the people.

3. **Foundation for Independence**: While initially framed as a demand for autonomy, the failure of the Pakistani state to address these grievances paved the way for the eventual call for independence. The 1970 elections, where the Awami League won a landslide victory on the promise of implementing the 6 points, set the stage for the liberation war in 1971.

In essence, the 6-Point Movement laid the ideological groundwork for Bangladesh's emergence as an independent nation.

### **Conclusion**
The 6-Point Movement was not merely a list of demands but a revolutionary charter that encapsulated East Pakistan's socio-economic and political struggles. Spearheaded by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Awami League, it challenged the oppressive structures of the Pakistani state and ignited a movement for self-determination. Its legacy endures as a testament to the power of collective action and the enduring quest for justice and dignity.

**Boxed Final Answer:**  
The 6-Point Movement, formulated by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1966, articulated East Pakistan's demands for autonomy, addressing economic disparity, political marginalization, and cultural suppression. It faced severe backlash from the Pakistani government but gained immense popular support, becoming a crucial step toward Bangladesh's eventual independence in 1971.
