**How to Use This Plan:**

- **Daily Blocks:** Treat each day as a distinct study block. Aim for focused study sessions each day, even if they are shorter but highly concentrated.
- **Breaks:** Take short breaks during your study sessions to maintain focus.
- **Review (Implicit):** Although there's no dedicated revision _day_, at the start of each day, briefly remind yourself of the key points from the previous day. This will help in building a connected understanding.
- **Flexibility (Limited):** While the plan is structured, if you find you need a bit more time on a particularly difficult concept, you _might_ borrow a little time from a less dense topic later, but try to stick to the overall schedule.
- **Active Recall:** After studying a section, try to recall the main points from memory before looking back at your notes. This is a powerful learning technique.
- **Engage with Course Materials:** Use your textbooks, lecture notes, and any other materials provided by your instructor as your primary study resources. This plan is a guide to structure your study of _those_ materials.

**Important Reminders for Success:**

- **Discipline is Key:** Sticking to a no-revision plan requires consistent daily effort and discipline.
- **Don't Get Discouraged:** Jurisprudence can be challenging. If you find a concept difficult, reread the material, consult other sources if helpful, and try to break it down into smaller parts.
- **Focus on Understanding, Not Just Coverage:** It’s better to deeply understand a slightly smaller portion of the syllabus than to superficially rush through everything. However, this plan is designed to be comprehensive if followed diligently.

Good luck with your exam preparation! Remember to stay consistent, engage actively with the material, and focus on understanding the core ideas each day.
