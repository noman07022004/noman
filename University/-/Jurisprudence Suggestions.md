**Tier 1: Absolutely Essential (High Chance of Direct Questions / Central to Multiple Topics)**

1. **H.L.A. Hart:** His version of Positivism (_The Concept of Law_, primary/secondary rules, Rule of Recognition, internal/external point of view, minimum content of natural law) is arguably the most central theory in modern Anglo-American jurisprudence. You _must_ understand him well. He's often contrasted with Austin, Kelsen, Dworkin, and Fuller.
2. **Ronald Dworkin:** As Hart's most prominent critic, his ideas (law as interpretation, principles vs. rules, law as integrity, one right answer thesis) are fundamental. The Hart-Dworkin debate is a cornerstone of many courses.
3. **The Core Natural Law vs. Positivism Debate:** Understand the fundamental disagreement: Is there a necessary connection between law and morality? Be able to articulate the basic stance of each camp, using key figures as examples.
4. **John Austin & Jeremy Bentham:** Representing classical positivism (Command Theory, Utilitarianism as legislative principle). Crucial for understanding what Hart was reacting against. Simple, foundational theories.
5. **St. Thomas Aquinas:** The key figure for Medieval Natural Law. His framework (types of law, connection of human to natural/eternal law, _lex injusta non est lex_) is foundational for much natural law thinking that follows, including Finnis.

**Tier 2: Highly Important (Very Likely to Appear, Key Schools/Figures)**

6. **Lon Fuller:** His Procedural Natural Law (inner morality of law, 8 principles) is a major modern natural law contribution. The Hart-Fuller debate is another classic pairing.
7. **John Finnis:** The leading modern _substantive_ natural law theorist (basic goods, practical reasonableness). Represents the contemporary Aristotelian/Thomist approach.
8. **Hans Kelsen:** His Pure Theory of Law (_Grundnorm_, hierarchy of norms) is a unique and influential strand of positivism, especially important in civil law traditions but core theory everywhere. It offers a distinct alternative to Austin/Hart.
9. **Thomas Hobbes & John Locke:** Key figures in Secular Natural Law and Social Contract theory. Their contrasting views on the state of nature, natural rights (especially Locke), and the purpose of government/law are foundational for political and legal philosophy. Locke's ideas on rights are particularly influential.
10. **Immanuel Kant:** His legal philosophy (Concept of Right, external freedom, relation to morality, autonomy) is profoundly influential on liberal thought and rights theory. Understand his distinction between legality and morality.

**Tier 3: Important Context / Possible Specific Questions**

11. **Aristotle:** His concepts of natural justice, _telos_, law's role in virtue and the _polis_ are foundational for Aquinas, Finnis, and natural law generally.
12. **Plato:** Important for the idea of ideal Justice (Forms) influencing law, but perhaps less likely to be a standalone question than Aristotle or later figures. Often used as an early example of natural law ideals.
13. **Sociology & Law (Marx & Weber):** Offer crucial _external_ critiques/perspectives on law's function in society. Weber's rationalization or Marx's base/superstructure could be specific questions, or used for critical essays.
14. **Critical Legal Studies (CLS) & Feminist Jurisprudence:** Represent major modern critical movements. Feminist Jurisprudence, in particular, is often a topic for specific essays examining law's relationship with gender. Understand their main critiques (indeterminacy, bias, power).
15. **Jean-Jacques Rousseau:** Important social contract theorist (General Will), but sometimes given slightly less focus in _jurisprudence_ courses compared to Hobbes and Locke, though still significant.
16. **Stoics & Sophists:** Crucial for the historical development of natural law ideas (universal reason, _physis_ vs _nomos_), but more likely to be background context or part of a broader question on classical natural law.

**Suggestions for Studying:**

1. **Focus on the Debates:** Don't just learn theorists in isolation. Understand how they respond to or contrast with each other (Hart vs. Austin, Hart vs. Dworkin, Hart vs. Fuller, Positivism vs. Natural Law, Locke vs. Hobbes). This shows deeper understanding.
2. **Master the Core Concepts:** For key figures like Hart, Dworkin, Kelsen, Aquinas, Austin â€“ make sure you can clearly define their core concepts (Rule of Recognition, Law as Integrity, Grundnorm, etc.).
3. **Group Theorists:** Study them by school (Classical Natural Law, Secular Natural Law, Positivism, Modern Natural Law, Critical Theories) to see the common threads and internal variations.
4. **Prioritize Based on Tiers:** Spend most time ensuring you have a solid grasp of Tiers 1 and 2. Use Tier 3 knowledge to add depth and context, and be prepared if a question comes up from there.
5. **Practice Questions:** Try to outline answers to potential questions like: "Compare and contrast Hart and Austin's theories of law," "Critically evaluate Dworkin's theory of law as integrity," "Explain the core tenets of Natural Law theory, using examples from two different eras," "Discuss the relationship between law and morality according to Legal Positivism," "How does Feminist Jurisprudence critique mainstream legal thought?"
