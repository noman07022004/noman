Okay, here is a comprehensive overview of the topics you provided, detailing the evolution of the judicial system in India through various historical periods:

**1. Judicial System of Ancient and Medieval India: Hindu, Sultanate and Mughal Period**

- **Ancient India (Hindu Period):**
    
    - **Concept of Dharma:** Law in ancient India was deeply intertwined with _Dharma_, encompassing religious, moral, and legal duties. The King was considered the fountainhead of justice, tasked with upholding Dharma.
    - **Sources of Law:** Key sources included the _Shrutis_ (Vedas), _Smritis_ (like Manusmriti, Yajnavalkyasmriti - compilations of laws and social codes), _Sadachara_ (customs of virtuous people), and _Atmatusti_ (what appeals to one's conscience, guided by Dharma). Royal edicts (_Rajasasana_) also formed a source of law.
    - **Hierarchy of Courts:** A decentralized system existed. At the local level, justice was often administered by village councils (_Kulani_), guilds (_Sreni_), and town assemblies (_Puga_). Above these were royal courts. The King's court was the highest court of appeal, often assisted by learned Brahmins (jurists), ministers, and elders.
    - **Procedure and Punishment:** Emphasis was placed on evidence, including witnesses, documents, and ordeals (in some periods/cases). Punishments ranged from fines and reprimands to corporal punishment and banishment, aimed at reformation and deterrence, guided by principles of fairness and caste considerations.
- **Sultanate Period (c. 1206-1526):**
    
    - **Introduction of Islamic Law:** With the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, Islamic law (_Sharia_) became the primary law for Muslims and, in criminal matters, often for non-Muslims too. Key sources were the _Quran_, _Sunnah_ (Prophet's traditions), _Ijma_ (consensus of jurists), and _Qiyas_ (analogical deduction).
    - **Judicial Structure:** The Sultan was the supreme judicial authority. Below him was the _Qazi-ul-Quzat_ (Chief Justice), heading the judicial department (_Diwan-i-Qaza_). Provincial _Qazis_ administered justice in provinces, assisted by _Muftis_ (expounders of law). A separate department, _Diwan-i-Mazalim_, handled complaints against government officials.
    - **Co-existence of Laws:** While Sharia was applied, particularly in criminal law and for Muslims in personal matters, Hindu customary laws continued to govern personal matters (marriage, inheritance) for the Hindu population, often administered through their own local panchayats.
- **Mughal Period (c. 1526-1857):**
    
    - **Refined Structure:** The Mughals largely continued the Sultanate's judicial structure but with greater organization. The Emperor was the highest court of appeal and held regular sessions (_Diwan-i-Aam_, _Diwan-i-Khas_).
    - **Hierarchy:** The _Qazi-ul-Quzat_ remained the chief judicial officer. Below him were provincial _Qazis_, district _Qazis_, and _Pargana_ (sub-district) _Qazis_. _Mir Adls_ often assisted Qazis, focusing on procedural aspects and judgments.
    - **Law Applied:** Islamic law (primarily the Hanafi school) was applied in criminal cases and Muslim personal law matters. Hindu personal law continued to apply to Hindus. Emphasis was placed on evidence, including eyewitness accounts. Emperor Aurangzeb commissioned the _Fatawa-i-Alamgiri_, a digest of Hanafi law, to standardize judicial practice. However, local customs often influenced judgments, especially in rural areas.

**2. Early Charters: Charter of 1600, King's Commission, Charter of 1661, Surat Factory**

- **Charter of 1600:** Granted by Queen Elizabeth I, this charter established the English East India Company (EIC) and gave it a 15-year monopoly on trade east of the Cape of Good Hope. Critically, it granted **limited legislative and judicial powers**. The EIC could make reasonable laws and ordinances for the good government of the company and its officers, and punish offences against these laws through fines or minor imprisonment, primarily aimed at maintaining discipline among its employees during voyages and in trading posts. It did **not** grant sovereignty or broad judicial powers over territories or inhabitants.
- **King's Commission:** The limited powers of the 1600 Charter were insufficient to deal with serious crimes like murder or mutiny, especially on long voyages. To address this, the Crown issued temporary "King's Commissions" to commanders of voyages, empowering them to inflict harsher punishments, including the death penalty, under martial law for such grave offences committed on the high seas.
- **Charter of 1661:** Issued by King Charles II, this charter marked a **significant expansion of the EIC's powers**. It authorized the Company to appoint Governors and Councils for its settlements. Crucially, it empowered the Governor and Council in each factory (settlement) to **judge all persons belonging to the Company or living under them**, in both civil and criminal matters, **according to the laws of England**. This was a major step, allowing the EIC to exercise judicial authority akin to a governing body within its settlements and extending English law's application to Indians residing therein.
- **Surat Factory:** Surat was the EIC's first major trading post ('factory') and early headquarters in India. Before the Charter of 1661 provided a clearer legal basis, justice administration was ad-hoc. The Company President and Council acted as a rudimentary court for Englishmen, often applying English common law principles. For disputes involving Indians, or between Indians within the factory limits, the approach was often pragmatic, sometimes respecting local customs or referring matters to local Mughal authorities, reflecting the EIC's initial status as traders under Mughal sufferance. The 1661 Charter aimed to formalize this system under English law.

**3. Administration of Justice: Madras (1639-1726), Calcutta (1690-1726), Mayor's court under the charter of 1726**

- **Madras (1639-1726):**
    
    - The EIC acquired Madraspatnam in 1639. Initially, justice was administered by the 'Agent' (later Governor) and Council, primarily for Englishmen.
    - A 'Choultry Court' was established early on, dealing mainly with petty civil and criminal cases involving Indian inhabitants, often applying customary laws.
    - An Admiralty Court was established in 1683, initially for maritime cases but later expanding its jurisdiction to civil and criminal matters based on English law and equity.
    - A Mayor's Court was briefly established under a Company charter in 1687 but had limited effectiveness. The overall system remained complex and inconsistent before 1726.
- **Calcutta (1690-1726):**
    
    - The EIC established its settlement in Calcutta around 1690. In 1698, it acquired the _zamindari_ (landlordship rights) of three villages (Sutanuti, Kalikata, Govindpur).
    - This unique _zamindari_ status meant the EIC Collector also acted as a judicial officer, running a _Zamindari Court_ (or _Faujdari_ court). This court dealt with revenue matters, civil disputes, and petty criminal cases involving the Indian population, applying prevailing local customs and Mughal administrative practices rather than English law. English law application was largely confined to Englishmen within the settlement.
- **Mayor's Court under the Charter of 1726:**
    
    - This Royal Charter, issued by King George I, was a watershed moment. It established **uniform judicial systems** in the Presidency towns of **Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta**.
    - It created **Mayor's Courts** in each town, consisting of a Mayor and nine Aldermen. These courts had jurisdiction over **civil cases** within the Presidency town and subordinate factories, applying principles of **English law and equity**.
    - It also established **Courts of Quarter Sessions** (composed of the Governor and Council) to handle **criminal cases**, applying English criminal law.
    - The Governor and Council also acted as the **appellate court** for decisions from the Mayor's Court (for cases exceeding a certain value). Further appeal lay to the King-in-Council (Privy Council) in England.
    - **Significance:** This charter formally and uniformly introduced English law as the territorial law within the Presidency towns, significantly impacting the diverse Indian populations residing there, who were often unfamiliar with its procedures and substance. It displaced existing indigenous and EIC-run courts within these towns.

### 4. Beginning of the Adalat System: Warren Hasting's measures, Judicial plan of 1772, Supreme court of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, Criminal Judicature after Cornwallis

- **Warren Hastings' Measures & Judicial Plan of 1772:**
    
    - Context: After the EIC acquired the _Diwani_ (right to collect revenue and administer civil justice) of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1765, the existing system under the Nawab's officers proved corrupt and inefficient. Warren Hastings, Governor of Bengal, sought to reform it.
    - **Plan of 1772:** This established a new structure for the _mofussil_ (areas outside Presidency towns):
        - **Mofussil Diwani Adalat:** Established in each district to handle civil cases. Presided over by the English Collector, applying Hindu law for Hindus and Muslim law for Muslims in personal matters (inheritance, marriage, etc.).
        - **Mofussil Faujdari Adalat:** Established in each district for criminal cases. Presided over by Indian officers (Qazis and Muftis) but supervised by the English Collector. Applied Muslim criminal law (as was customary).
        - **Sadar Diwani Adalat:** Set up in Calcutta as the chief appellate court for civil cases from Mofussil Diwani Adalats. Presided over by the Governor and Council.
        - **Sadar Nizamat Adalat:** Set up in Murshidabad (later moved to Calcutta) as the chief appellate court for criminal cases from Mofussil Faujdari Adalats. Headed by an Indian judge (Daroga-i-Adalat) under the supervision of the Governor and Council.
    - **Significance:** This marked the beginning of the Anglo-Indian 'Adalat System', attempting to regulate justice based on Indian laws but under British supervision. It also partially separated executive (Collector) and judicial functions, though the Collector retained significant influence.
- **Supreme Court of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras:**
    
    - **Calcutta (1774):** Established by the Regulating Act of 1773 (implemented 1774). It was a King's Court (distinct from the Company's Adalats) staffed by English judges, applying English law. Its jurisdiction extended to British subjects in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, employees of the EIC, and inhabitants of Calcutta. Conflicts arose with the Sadar Diwani Adalat due to overlapping jurisdictions and the application of English law to situations involving Indians outside Calcutta (e.g., the famous Cossijurah case). The Act of Settlement (1781) later clarified its jurisdiction, largely restricting it to Calcutta and British subjects.
    - **Madras (1801) & Bombay (1823):** Similar Supreme Courts were established later by Acts of Parliament, replacing earlier Recorder's Courts. They had comparable structures and jurisdictions within their respective Presidencies, applying English law and co-existing, often uneasily, with the Company's Adalat system operating in the mofussil areas.
- **Criminal Judicature after Cornwallis:**
    
    - Lord Cornwallis, Governor-General (1786-1793), introduced significant reforms aiming to improve efficiency, reduce corruption, and further separate powers.
    - **Reforms of 1790 & 1793 (Cornwallis Code):**
        - He effectively took over criminal justice administration from the Nawab's officials. The Mofussil Faujdari Adalats were abolished.
        - Four **Courts of Circuit** were established, presided over by English judges from the Company's civil service. These courts toured districts to try serious criminal cases.
        - The Sadar Nizamat Adalat was reorganized and placed directly under the Governor-General and Council, assisted by Indian law officers (Chief Qazi, Muftis).
        - The Collector was divested of all judicial powers (magisterial functions given to District Judges initially), achieving a greater separation between executive and judiciary.
        - Significant modifications were made to Muslim criminal law (e.g., relating to evidence, punishments for murder) to align it more with British notions of justice.

**5. Adalat System in Bengal and Beyond: Lord William Bentinck, Reorganization of criminal judicature, Reforms of civil judicature, Revolution of 1831, Madras province, Bombay province, Indian judges in three provinces**

- **Lord William Bentinck (Governor-General 1828-1835):** Bentinck's reforms were driven by a desire for economy, efficiency, and greater involvement of Indians in the administration.
    
    - **Abolition of Courts:** He abolished the Provincial Courts of Appeal and Circuit, which were seen as inefficient and slow.
    - **Transfer of Functions:** Their appellate civil jurisdiction was transferred to the District Diwani Adalats. Their criminal sessions work was transferred to the District Judges, who became Sessions Judges.
    - **Commissioner Role:** Commissioners of Revenue and Circuit were appointed to supervise revenue and police matters, and initially held sessions trials (later transferred to District Judges).
    - **Empowerment of Collectors:** Partially reversing Cornwallis's separation, Collectors were given magisterial powers and authority over the police.
- **Reorganization of Criminal Judicature:** The key changes were the abolition of the cumbersome Circuit Courts and the transfer of their trial functions (sessions) to the District Judges. This aimed to speed up criminal justice.
    
- **Reforms of Civil Judicature:** A major focus was alleviating the burden on English judges and promoting Indians.
    
    - **Indian Judicial Officers:** The powers and status of Indian judges were significantly enhanced. Posts like **Principal Sadar Ameens, Sadar Ameens, and Munsiffs** were established or strengthened, with increased pecuniary jurisdiction to hear civil suits. This allowed the bulk of civil litigation to be handled by Indians.
    - **Vernacular Languages:** Use of vernacular languages was encouraged in lower courts.
- **Revolution of 1831:** This term often refers to the cumulative impact of Bentinck's reforms, particularly the **increased Indianization of the judicial services** at lower and intermediate levels, marking a significant shift in administrative policy. It aimed to make justice more accessible and less expensive.
    
- **Madras Province:** The judicial system evolved similarly but with regional variations. The Madras Regulation system developed alongside Bengal's. Reforms under Sir Thomas Munro emphasized the role of the Collector-Magistrate. Indian judicial officers (District Munsiffs, Sadar Ameens) were also employed extensively.
    
- **Bombay Province:** Developed under the Bombay Regulation Code (influenced by Mountstuart Elphinstone). It also saw the integration of Adalat courts and later reforms incorporating Indian judges. The system sometimes differed in nomenclature and the specific powers vested in officials like the Collector.
    
- **Indian Judges in Three Provinces:** Bentinck's reforms were pivotal in establishing a hierarchy of Indian judges (Munsiffs, Ameens, Sadar Ameens, Principal Sadar Ameens) across Bengal, Madras, and Bombay presidencies. They handled a vast majority of original civil suits, gaining trust and experience, though appellate jurisdiction largely remained with European judges until later.
    

**6. Establishment of High Courts: Dual Judicature before 1861, Indian High Court's Act 1861, High court's under the government of India Act 1935**

- **Dual Judicature before 1861:** Prior to 1861, India had two parallel, distinct judicial systems:
    
    - **Crown's Courts:** The Supreme Courts in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, established by Royal Charter/Act of Parliament, applying English law.
    - **Company's Courts:** The Sadar Adalats (Sadar Diwani Adalat for civil, Sadar Nizamat Adalat for criminal) at the Presidency level, heading the hierarchy of Mofussil Adalats in the districts, applying personal laws (Hindu/Muslim) and Regulations enacted by the Company.
    - This duality led to jurisdictional conflicts, procedural complexities, and inconsistencies in law application.
- **Indian High Courts Act 1861:**
    
    - Passed by the British Parliament, this landmark Act **abolished both the Supreme Courts and the Sadar Adalats**.
    - It authorized the Crown to establish, by Letters Patent, **High Courts of Judicature** in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay (and later Allahabad in 1866, and others subsequently).
    - These High Courts **merged the jurisdictions** of the abolished Supreme Courts and Sadar Adalats, creating a unified judicial system within each Presidency/province.
    - They were vested with **Original Jurisdiction** (in Presidency towns, similar to Supreme Courts) and **Appellate Jurisdiction** (over subordinate courts in the entire province, similar to Sadar Adalats). They also had supervisory powers over all lower courts.
    - This Act unified the court structure and paved the way for greater uniformity in law and procedure across British India.
- **High Courts under the Government of India Act 1935:**
    
    - This Act provided a detailed framework for the High Courts within the proposed (though never fully realized) Federation of India.
    - It defined their constitution, appointment and qualifications of judges, tenure, salaries, and powers.
    - It continued their existing jurisdictions (original, appellate, supervisory) and confirmed their status as Courts of Record.
    - It outlined the relationship between the High Courts and the newly established **Federal Court of India** (which heard appeals from High Courts in certain cases, particularly involving constitutional interpretation). The Act solidified the High Courts' position as the apex courts at the provincial level within the constitutional structure preceding independence.

**7. Privy Council: Jurisdiction, Appeals as of right, Progress of Indian appeals**

- **Jurisdiction:** The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) in London served as the **highest court of appeal** from courts in British India (initially from Supreme Courts and Sadar Adalats, later from High Courts and the Federal Court). It heard appeals in both civil and criminal matters, interpreting Indian statutes, personal laws (Hindu and Muslim), and applying English common law principles where applicable.
- **Appeals:**
    - **Appeals as of Right:** These were generally allowed in civil cases if the monetary value of the dispute exceeded a certain threshold (e.g., Rs. 10,000) and involved a substantial question of law, or if the High Court certified the case as fit for appeal.
    - **Appeals by Special Leave:** Parties could petition the High Court or the Privy Council itself for special leave to appeal, even if the conditions for appeal 'as of right' were not met, typically granted in cases involving significant legal principles or gross miscarriage of justice. Criminal appeals were generally allowed only by special leave, requiring exceptional circumstances.
- **Progress of Indian Appeals:** A large volume of appeals went from India to the Privy Council. Its decisions were binding on all Indian courts and played a crucial role in:
    - Shaping the development of law in India.
    - Settling conflicting interpretations of law among different High Courts.
    - Interpreting and standardizing aspects of Hindu and Muslim personal laws (though sometimes criticized for applying English legal concepts inappropriately).
    - Integrating principles of English common law and equity into the Indian legal system.
    - Its jurisdiction over Indian appeals ceased after India became a Republic (effectively from 1949/1950, with the establishment of the Supreme Court of India).

**8. India Wins Independence: Government of India Act 1935, Indian Independence Act 1947, Development of law and legal institutions in Pakistan**

- **Government of India Act 1935:** This was the last major constitutional framework provided by the British for India before independence.
    
    - It proposed a **Federal structure** for India (linking provinces and princely states, though the federal part was never fully implemented).
    - It granted significant **Provincial Autonomy**.
    - It established the **Federal Court of India** (operational from 1937), which acted as an appellate court below the Privy Council and had original jurisdiction in disputes between provinces or between the federation and provinces.
    - It continued the High Courts and defined their powers within the constitutional setup. It served as the basis for the interim constitutions of both India and Pakistan after 1947.
- **Indian Independence Act 1947:**
    
    - Passed by the British Parliament, this Act formalized the end of British rule.
    - It **partitioned British India** into the two independent Dominions of India and Pakistan, effective from August 15, 1947.
    - It declared British paramountcy over the princely states lapsed, leaving them free to accede to either Dominion or remain independent (though this option was practically short-lived).
    - It provided that the Government of India Act 1935 (with necessary adaptations) would serve as the interim constitution for both Dominions until they framed their own.
    - It **abolished the jurisdiction of the Privy Council** over Indian courts, paving the way for the Supreme Courts of India and Pakistan to become the ultimate judicial authorities in their respective countries.
- **Development of Law and Legal Institutions in Pakistan:**
    
    - Pakistan, upon creation in 1947, inherited the same legal and judicial framework as India, based on the adapted Government of India Act 1935 and existing British Indian laws.
    - It established its own **Federal Court** (later renamed Supreme Court of Pakistan).
    - Over time, Pakistan developed its own distinct legal path through:
        - Framing its own Constitutions (1956, 1962, 1973), which incorporated Islamic principles to varying degrees.
        - Enacting specific legislation reflecting its national priorities and Islamic identity (e.g., Objectives Resolution, Islamization measures under Zia-ul-Haq).
        - Judicial interpretations by its Supreme Court and High Courts shaping its unique jurisprudence.
    - The legal system continues to be based on the common law tradition but with significant modifications and the incorporation of Islamic law, particularly in areas like family law and certain criminal matters (Hudood Ordinances).

**9. Post-colonial Aspects of Legal History: Rise of nationalism and its critique, History from sub-altern perspectives**

- **Rise of Nationalism and its Critique (of Colonial Law):**
    
    - The Indian nationalist movement had a complex relationship with the colonial legal system. Many prominent nationalist leaders (Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Jinnah) were lawyers trained in the British system and used legal processes and rights discourse to challenge colonial rule.
    - However, nationalists also **critiqued the colonial legal system** as:
        - An instrument of foreign domination and control.
        - Alien in its procedures and substance, often inaccessible and incomprehensible to ordinary Indians.
        - Serving primarily British economic and political interests.
        - Being used to suppress political dissent (e.g., sedition laws, preventive detention).
        - Reinforcing racial hierarchies and discrimination.
    - Post-independence, while India adopted the basic structure of the Anglo-Indian legal system (courts, common law principles, statutes), there was a conscious effort to 'Indianize' it by enshrining fundamental rights, directive principles of state policy, and judicial review in the Constitution, aiming to transform law from a tool of colonial control into an instrument of social justice and national development.
- **History from Subaltern Perspectives:**
    
    - Subaltern Studies emerged as a school of historical thought challenging elite-centric (colonial or nationalist) narratives of Indian history. It focuses on the experiences, agency, and perspectives of marginalized groups – peasants, tribals, lower castes, women, industrial workers – the 'subalterns'.
    - In legal history, a subaltern perspective examines:
        - How colonial law was actually experienced by ordinary people at the grassroots level, often differently from its intended application.
        - How subaltern groups interacted with, resisted, subverted, or utilized the formal legal system.
        - The persistence and significance of informal, community-based justice systems alongside the state's legal apparatus.
        - How law impacted social relations, power dynamics, and everyday life beyond the major political or constitutional developments.
        - The role of law in constructing and reinforcing social hierarchies (caste, class, gender) even while ostensibly promoting 'rule of law'.
    - This approach provides a more nuanced and bottom-up understanding of legal history, highlighting the limitations and contradictions of the formal legal system and the voices often excluded from traditional accounts.
