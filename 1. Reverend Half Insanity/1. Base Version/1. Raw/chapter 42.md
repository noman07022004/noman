Fang Yuan come back from the memory but his face shows that he is completely shocked, terrified. He can't utter a word. Everything around him seems to go black. Now, his condition is worse, don't understand what really he is. Is he the messenger of love who is loved by everyone or this terrifying monster. He is even more terrified and shocked and almost again go mad as just this morning he has gain back the memory of his previous life where he went mad as he can't save those innocent life from those monster but now at night he finds out that he is even worse that all those monster. He always asks why anyone can be that much brutal and finding no answer no solition, he went mad now he finds himself even more brutal than everything he has seen in his previous life. His whole body is trembling. All those clashing opposite like the man him who can't save anyone, can't prevent any innocent soul be destroyed by those monster, the messenger of love who saves everyone, help other and even successfully give them a better life, and the future self which is demonic monster worse then the monster he has seen in his previous life who kill innocent soul with utmost brutality. All those clashing identity is now making him mad. 

Fang Yuan has gone mad and now he wants to end his life after seeing what he has done to yao le but can even move as his whole body has frozzen and trembling seeing How monsterous he is! 

He doesn't know if it is a dream or is it a real life. He is very guilty, hateful, fearful of himself now. As how he has just killed his childhood friend yao le.

suddenly, fang yuan hears a voice "Brother Fang Yuan! are you alright? Why are you acting like this. please become normal" this is the voice of yao le and yao le's face is right before him. from side fang sianer, cries out and says, "My love! Please! Please!" from behind, Fang Ma cries out, "MY son, my love! please don't be afraid. Mama is here! All of us is here! Don't be afraid."

Seeing Yao Le alive, his eyes can't believe it. with those trembling body and fearful, shocked and crying face. He violently embrace yao le. THere was no sound in fang yuan's cry before but now he is crying loudly tightly embracing yao le. After a few moment, as cries become sobs and Fang Yuan starts checking all parts of yao le's body and still crying but relief can be seen in his eyes but yao le feels a bit uncomfortable and shy and fang yuan grabs her cheeks, hairs, hands, thai, leg, brest and other part. Even though a relief can be seen but it can't be noticed before his terrified, fearful expression. 

after checking and confirming that she is really yao le and completely fine, he hugs yao le tightly. through out this time he hasn't utter a single word as his brain and mind has faced unimiginable damage from all those clashing memories. And so they aren't working properly and fang yuan is acting out of instincts only.

Yao Le is confused but hugs fang yuan back and says, "Don't worry brother fang yuan! I am here!"

Fang Sianer and Fang Ma comforts fang yuan and try to calm him down. Hours passes by and fang yuan is still embracing yao le tightly and it seems fang yuan can't understand their words. 

Fang ma's face looks very empty and also worried. "It looks like the novel's future demonic fang yuan is trying to take over my fang yuan. But I will never let my son to be taken. I will protect at all cost even if it cost my life because now you are not the fang yuan in novel but my son, my love. And now that I recall the horrifying bear scene where I dropped the novel. If i think properly, fang yuan's condition become like this after seeing yao le's face and voice and then he checks yao le again and agian to confirm that she is alright and then he is embracing yao le for hours and it looks like he can't even hear and understand anything and just embracing yao le which means fang yuan has seen something very bad about yao le and he must have seen the bear scene where he feed yao le to the bear. and if I recall what fang yuan told me yesterday that rejecting by your won past younger self which indicates that the future self must be trying to take control of my son. No, I will not let it happen."

And then with resolute face she says, "Yao Le it looks like fang yuan really likes you and at least you are not going to get away from his embrace."

"Yao le responds shyly, it isn't a big deal."

"then why don't you sleep in that way because it looks like my son will not let you go today."

She shyly responds affirmatively.

then fang ma gently let fang yuan and yao le lye down on the bed and fang yuan is still hugging yao le tightly. Then Fang Ma uses martial artificates on fang yuan to give him boost of energy and it will also help him become calm and also remove all hunger or fetigue.

Then Fang Ma says to Fang Sianer who is still sobbing and watching fang yuan. "My Sianer, why don't you sleep beside your brother, you know that your brother really loves you and if you sleep beside him, he will recover soon."

"Really!" Then fang sianer who was sitting now sleeping beside fang yuan. 

Fang Ma ponders, "I have checked Fang Sianer's martial core and essence. And my estimition was right there is a peaceful, healing, comfortable aura around fang sianer which will help fang yuan recover quickly. And now that I recall my memory of my previous life, green represent healing and her martial core and essence is also green that means it must have direct healing attribute and it must be very rare."
