Fang Yuan now standing before yao le coldly, gently pet the bear and says, "The lightning wolf has eaten up all the prey and so, the bear hasn't eaten proper meal for a long time."

As the bear moves forwards Yao Le with hungry gaze, Yao le shouts, "Fang Yuan! stop! What are you planning to do?"

But before she can get answer from fang yuan, the bear gives her answer by striking her skull with its paw.

The intense force breaks her thin neck. Her head is twisted at a creepy angle, broken and hanging on one end.

One moment ago, she was still an alluring beauty, and the next moment she is a corpse. Her warm body ties to the huge rock, is like a broken toy doll.

At this moment, even without his control of the Bear Enslavement Martial Parasite, with its craving for food, the big bear has already lowered its head, enjoying this sumptuous meal.

It first starts to gnaw at the young girl’s throat, and fresh blood immediately bubbles out, splashing onto its black fur.

Next is the young girl’s white and tender breasts.

The black bear bits on her right breast in one whole mouthful, tearing away the skin and flesh, exposing her deathly pale ribs.

At this moment, the black bear uses its paw to break these bones. The young girl’s internal organs are crushed, and immediately blood poured out endlessly.

Without the skeleton’s interference, the black bear places its mouth further into the girl’s body. It nips at the girl’s heart that are still beating, then proceeds to swallow it in one mouthful.

The heart passes through its throat and into the stomach, and this bear that has to hide around and can’t eat due to the wolf tide, howled out in satisfaction.  

After another cry, it lowers its head again and starts to consume her internal organs wantonly.

The black bear’s mouth opens and chews, large amounts of blood gushing out from its mouth, issuing a watery sound.

After a good while, the black bear finally moves its head out.

The young girl’s chest is already empty, the immense injury extending to her stomach. But towards the shining, white intestines, the bear does not seem to have much interest.

It starts to focus on the young girl’s white slim legs.

The girl’s jade-like fingers are all bitten away by the black bear at once, and with a few rounds of chewing, the fingers are swallowed with a crisp sound.

The girl’s thighs are also a delicacy for the bear.

The tender skin and flesh of her thighs emits a virgin fragrance. When the bear has finished, all that is left is the white leg bones.

Among the swaying movements, the girl’s skull finally drops onto the ground. 

Fang Yuan is standing here seeing her tragic and violent death, his heart is unmoved. 

That is not because of his numbness to death, but he has gone beyond the superficial, having no obsessions. 

Without a sense of self, without a sense of person, to be detached of all living things, detached of the sense of time...

Seeing all living things as equal, the world is equal. 

Thus, the girl’s death is no different from a fox or a tree’s death.  

He observes for around one hour as the black bear completely eaten her up.

The black bear is unwilling to eat the intestines and the girl’s brains.

Seeing that he ponders, "How can you not eat her up fully! You have to eat up the last piece of her otherwise how am I going to successfully refine you to a martial elixir which will increate my talent and allow me to break through to the rank 3 martial master."

Then Fang Yuan uses the Bear Enslavement Martial Parasite that is in the bear's body through his mind and then the big bear growles, and under Fang Yuan’s oppression, is forced to swallow the intestines and brain. At the same time, it breaks the girl’s bones to bits and swallows them piece by piece.

The bone shards are sharp and pointy, but under Fang Yuan’s control, it swallows them and many of the shards stabs into its mouth and throat, the pain causing the huge bear to tear up.

But He only strengthens his control, and the bear’s body is no longer under its own control.

Fang Yuan's looks at the bears expressionlessly who has completely swallowed Yao Le and not even a single bone spared. The bears is crying out loud by the pain of swallowing the bone and those bone has already tear its throat, mouth and internal organs apart.

"I need a virgin girl with high martial talent. And the condition is fulfilled and the new condition is to fed that girl completely to an animal like bear. The third condition is to starts refining the martial elixir before the bear dies. This is a demonic technique to increase someone martial talent and rank. "

Then without delaying, fang yuan starts refining the bear with all other ingredients that he has prepared long before.
