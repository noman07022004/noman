The river of flowers is a place of beauty where hope thrived and dreams took fight. Its water level hovered just above ankle but below knee, shimmering with glowing fish that swam gracefully among the beautiful flower. Tiny bugs are playing on the surface. Every element here, the flowers, the bugs, the fishes and even the water and rock, all glow dimly are actually various kind of martial parasite. 

They contain the essence of hope. As someone walk through them, they start glowing brightly by the hope that the person carries. The more the person carries hope, the more hope martial parasite gather around them with more bright light. But as they gathered around with bright light, it creates a lot of pressure accordingly on the person and the more higher their talents is, the more pressure they creates. Those pressure of hope helps them to open their martial talents. So, that means those who contain more natural born talents would ultimately attracts more hope martial parasite with more brightness which will ultimately help them open their martial talents. In simple word, someone's talent is like electricity and those hope martial parasite are like lights.

There are many method to awaken someone's martial talents, and it is one of them but in every case their is indeed need of hope to awaken someone's martial talent.

Fang Yuan comes out of his memory and now looks extremely terrified. His whole body is shaking, eyes are wide open with shocked. He has taken only a few steps and collapses on the on the river ground. 

As he collapses, he uses his two hands unknowingly before him which allow him to now sink and make him look like kneeling. The more astonishing part is that he has gathered not a single hope martial parasite around him. Even more astonishing part is that all the hope martial parasite those can run away contains bugs and fishes are running away from him as if afraid of their confirmed doomed. And then the horrifying part, all the hope martial parasite that can't run which include beautiful flower around him, rock beneath him and water around him not only loosing their glow but also starts becoming darker and darker. It starts spreading like a virous and starting from fang yuan's kneeling point, the hope martial parasite starts loosing their dim light and even more is spread quickly around making other also loose their beautiful dim light.

The whole ecosystem of the river of flower has already started transforming black from dim light, as if the very essence of hope itself has been poisoned by the abyss of his despair. It is as if the hope itself has fallen into despair, unable to withstand the crushing weight of Fang Yuan's abyss of despair.

Now, Fang Yuan's face and eyes looks like it has lost hope long before and only a living shell which is moving by the abyss of despair. And his condition of become like this is justifiable as in his previous life after loosing his wife and daughters in tragic fate, he started thinking he could prevent other girls and women from facing those tragic fate but no matter how much he tried, he couldn't stop prevent. At best he could give justice to the victims but what about the damage that has already infected. No matter who is in this situation who go mad from despair.

And this is the very condition of Fang Yuan right now. Again fall into the abyss of despair that he was in before reincarnation. Actually the world is very dark and if you think and observe very carefully, you will find that all positive things like hope, love, compassion, kindness is just a lie and they are just a simple layer of mask to hide the dark reality from us. That is way those who uncover those mask can never become happy in their life as they has seen the truth. And there is a saying, "No tree can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell."

Seeing fang yaun's struggle and the condition of the flower of river, everyone become shocked. And Fang Ma even though she wants to run at Fang Yuan, can't run and freezes on the spot because she is too shocked from horrifying scene. And everyone starts feeling a sense of hopelessness that is rapidly spreading from the river of flower.

But suddenly, Fang Yuan's hopeless, terrified, shocked face starts to loose emotion. First his one eyes become emotionless and his gaze become indifferent and then the other eyes and then his facial expression and then gradually the violent shaking of his whole body starts fading away. 

But before the whole process finished, Fang Sianer rushes towards Fang Yuan crying out loud, "My love! My brother!"

Hearing this voice, the indifference expression begins to fade away rapidly. But suddenly Fang Yuan's one eyes become completely indifferent and other eyes looks terrified by the feelings. One eyes isn't even blinking a single time and gazing indifferently. But the other eyes is blinking rapidly sometime with indifferent expression and sometime with terrified expression. As if someone is trying to taking control over the body.

Suddenly Fang Sianer come before fang yuan and embrace him crying, "My love! You don't have to worry, talent doesn't matter."

The indifference expression starts to fade away completely.

Fang Ma has already rushed towards fang yuan who looks totally despaired and broken.

Suddenly, Fang Yuan both eyes and face become expressionless and then his hands violently grabs Fang Sianer's neck and starts crushing her neck. Now his eyes are indifferent but tears are flowing like stream.

But before anything can happen, Fang Ma embrace fang yuan from behind and she is crying, "My son! My love! Don't lose your hope. Mama is here. I know you are facing very difficult situation but please don't lose hope. You mama and you little sister is with you to help you out."

The grabs of Fang Sianer's neck looses and the indifferent expression starts to vanish rapidly. And then Fang Yuan's eyes looks terrified with tears flowing from them rapidly as he looks at his hands of Fang Sianer's neck.

Then he violently pushes closer to him and embraces her very tightly as if he is going to lose the very precious thing that is even more valuable then his life itself and crying violently.

The scene is really emotional and beautiful as Fang Sianer is embracing fang yuan from front and fang yuan is as well and Fang Ma is embracing him from behind. They all are crying.

Suddenly the most beautiful scene starts happening, the hope martial parasites start gaining back their vitality. The flower around them start glowing and the water also starts glowing, the rock beneath also starts glowing which all of them become dark. The bugs starts flying around them with bright light. The fish also starts swimming around them glowing. It’s as if the entire River of Flowers has been reborn—not merely restored to its former glory, but elevated to a state of divine splendor.

But still there is no light of hope around fang yuan and still dark beneath and around him but the range is very small as the glow of hope from both fang ma and fang sianer is trying to extenguish it. The scene is really beautiful and spectacular, All the hope martial parasite is circling Fang Sianer and Fang Ma while sharply avoiding Fang Yuan. The scene is astonishing because the scene is like a tiny dark dot between two massive bright light circles.
