All the remaining martial masters around Yao Le, including her remaining bodyguards, the injured those whom she healed and those whom she hasn't healed yet, all try to take her to a safe distance, deep inside the village. 

But how can fang yuan let them do it. Fang Yuan again starts manipulating the whole wolf tide and even the martial masters. He creates a big explosion at the road that they were following to take her to the safe area. And It looks like fang Yuan has planted those explosion before and now just give the signal and thus this much explosion happened that it totally destroyed a few buildings and also killed many martial masters. 

It becomes even more chaotic. Fang Yuan even attacked some martial masters those who were taking her to the safe palace and create weak point in their defense. The lightning wolfs attack are relentless which cause the death of many. Thanks to fang Yuan's manipulation, rather than taking yao le to the safe palace in the village, they go outside the village.

As the reach outside the village, there is only 3 martial masters around yao le and everyone else has died. Yao Le is crying desperately as she has never imagined something brutal like this. 

They start taking a bit rest as they are at a pretty outside from the village and here there is barely any lightning wolf. One of her guard says, "Young mistress, don't be afraid, we will protect you even if it cost our life."

Yao Le cries out shouting, "Why they have to die for? Why even they have to die?"

But before the guard can comfort her, they heard something coming out of the jungle. They quickly takes position but they becomes shocked as they see a king lightning wolf comes out of the jungle.

Among her guard, a male and a female guard exchanges a smile but these smile hides deep pain and sorrow as these smile is a smile when you give it to your lover as you know this is the last smile you pass to your lover. They know that this is their end.

As there were only three martial master two are guard and other is the injured whom Yao Le has treated. All of them make takes their position and then the female guard shouts, "Young mistress, please run forward! Don't look backward." She is giving a smile at Yao Le but those smile hides deep sorrow. Yao Le shouts, "How can I! How can I!"

The male guard shouts but tears are flowing, "Do you want the sacrifice of all to go in vain. They have sacrificed themself to protect you. Do you want their sacrifice to go in vail."

The injured martial master shouts, "Young mistress! You have treated me and I am deeply indebted to you! You are such a gentle soul. Don't worry about us! Please run." 

Then the female guard shouts and now crying, "Please run! Please run! and don't forget our sacrifice! and don't let our sacrifice go in vain."

Suddenly, The kind lightning wolf jumped and attacked them violently.

Yao Le runs at the jungle crying with terrified face. Then she heard the shouts of her male guards shouting her lovers name. She continues to run crying and terrified.
