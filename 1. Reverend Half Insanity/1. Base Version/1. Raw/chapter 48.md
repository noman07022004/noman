Another week passes by quickly. During this time, Fang Sianer has continuously injected her primeval essence into Fang Yuan's martial core. And Fang Ma and Yao Le helped Fang Sianer to replenish her martial essence. They continued this process after taking some rest and it was non-stop. They didn't miss a single day.

Now Fang Yuan's face looks peaceful and calm. And he looks even more healthy. And Yao Le looks most exhausted and then Fang Ma. But surprisingly Fang Sianer's condition is pretty good only a small exhaustion can be seen.

Right now they all are working hard, Fang Sianer is injecting her martial essence in Fang Yuan's martial core while Fang Ma is injecting her martial essence in fang sianer's martial core to replenish her martial essence. And Yao Le is taking rest lying beside Fang Yuan while looking at fang yuan's face with loving and hopeful gaze.

At that moment, Fang Yuan's eye starts to open up and his vision starts becoming clear and clear. Seeing Fang Yuan opening his eyes, Yao Le's eyes becomes wide open with disbelief. She sits up shouting Brother Fang Yuan.

Hearing this sudden loud sound, Fang Yuan looks at Yao Le but his vision is unclear as his eyes haven't opened for a single time for about more then a month. So he starts rubbing his eyes while sitting up as Fang Yuan is feeling very strong and fit. 

Then Yao Le jumps at Fang Yuan. Her emotion is overwhelming as Before fainting, Fang Yuan was checking Yao Le and then hugged her tightly. So, all those emotion flooded out.

Fang Ma opens up her eyes as soon as she heard Yao Le's voice but Fang Sianer only opens up her eyes when fang yuan pulls his hand to rub his eyes as Fang Sianer was in deep concentration.

Seeing Fang Yuan wake up,  Fang Ma cries out, "Oh, my son! my love! you have finally wake up!" even though she looks exhausted, her expression and the tears of joys outshine them. And she quickly embrace Fang Yuan as her emotion is also overwhelming.

The same happens to Fang Sianer, she shouts out, "my love!" and embrace him while the tears of joy are flowing like stream.

Fang Yuan becomes confused and try to understand what is going on. For him it was like he has just open from sleep. Fang Yuan asks with confusion, "Is there something wrong?"

They unifiely replies "No! we are just happy."

Then As fang yuan looks at yao le's face clearly, he feels that his past memories are coming back and then he sees what how he make Yao Le into martial elixir to increase his martial talent. Tears again starts flowing and he feels suffocation, and starts trembling while wide open eyes.

Seeing this sudden change, Fang Ma, Fang Sianer and Yao Le's heart stop for a moment and then starts beating faster and faster from the fear of loosing fang yuan again. This time fang yuan doesn't faint but his condition is worse and he opens his mouth several times to say but words can't pass through his throat.

Fang Ma, Fang Sianer and Yao Le are still embracing fang yuan from all direction. But yuan is only looking at yao le with trying several time to utter words and also tries several time to extends his hands towards yao le but can't do it as it is trembling violnetly and even more he is extremely fearful towards those hands, those mouth of his, and even his own being. 

Why fang yuan feels different this time because, previously he felt that someone is forcefully injecting memories into him and then forcefully showing him but this time he feels that he just recalls a long lost memories which describes who he really is.

Times goes by, but fang yuan's condition doesn't change but becomes more worse because he is terrified of himself now. 

Because in his previous life in earth, he fought against those monsters, he becomes mad after finding out that the darkness of the world and those monsters can never be stopped but even in his mad state he continued to fight against the darkness of the world and those monsters and eventually died while fighting.

And in his current life, he is know to all as the messenger of love. Who helps everyone. Bring smile and hope to those who needed it. Everyone around him love him, admire him. He his his loved one around him. 

But as he recalls that memories that his future self carried to the past, He becomes terrified looking at himself as he is the one who helped those who need help, he is the one who faught against those darkness and monsters, he is the one who brough smile to that face that doesn't give a genuine smile in decades, he gives hope to those who lost and now he recalls that what he really is! He is even more monsterous and darker that of he has been fighting, He actually snatched smile and make other feels terrified and hopeless.
