Yao Le is running through the jungle. She is crying and completely terrified and doesn't know how long is she running. Fang Yuan is also moving while following Yao Le from a distance. Then Yao Le heard a voice inside her mind, "Don't go straight. Turn left."

She unconsciously follows the instruction and then she notices that she has avoided a group of lightning wolfs. Then the voice ask him to go other direction. and she follows. fang Yuan gives his instructions and Yao Le follows them. After sometime, she finds herself before a cave. 

But before she can fully process anything, Fang Yuan comes out of the dark jungle. Yao Le sensing someone coming out of the jungle says with respects, "Senior are you the one who helped me?"

But fang yuan stands before her and with the help of the little moon light, Yao Le shouts, "Fang Yuan! You were the one who helped me?"

Fang Yuan responds, "No, I am just simply helping myself."

Yao Le asks with confusion, "What!"

But fang yuan doesn't answer rather with a blink of an eyes using his martial parasite, he goes behind yao le and attacks her at her neck which cause her to faint on the spot.

Then fang yuan holds Yao Le by her waist and takes her to the dark cave. There he binds yao le's hands tightly behind her back and loops the rope around her neck and ties her to a large rock.

Then Fang Yuan leaves the cave. The night passes by quickly and the morning sun is rising. Yao Le wakes up and finds herself binds. She desperately tries to make her free but can't.

She looks very terrified and thinks what could possibly Fang Yuan do to her. Yao Le ponders, "Doesn't fang yuan want me to starve to death because I have complained about his wrong doings."

Then giving a pause, "Maybe he just want to punishment for 2 or 3 days and afterward will let me go."

Then with anger she shouts, "I will not forgive you fang yuan. I will never."

Then she hears footsteps outside and her heart skip for a bit as she ponders with fear, "Do fang yuan want to rape me? No! I will never forgive him and I will punish him for all his wrong doing after I go back to village."

Fang Yuan slowly enters the cave. A big bear is following him obediently.

Seeing Fang Yuan, Yao Le shouts, "Fang Yuan! Let me go now! Otherwise, my grandma will deal with you."

Seeing her struggle, Fang Yuan says coldly, "You sure are lively."

She is still crying from fear and rage, but she soon saw a large bear moving behind Fang Yuan.

Seeing the big bear behind fang yuan moving obediently, she becomes shocked and then shouts, "So, you have used the Bear Enslave Martial Parasite that you have exchange for your merits to enslave this large bear."

He laughs coldly, stretching out his hand and caressing the bearâ€™s black fur, his voice fills with coldness that flows in the cave like ominous winds, "Because of the wolf tide, it was not easy to find such a wild bear, it took me lots of time and effort to find it." 

Yao Le shouts, "So you want to make me fearful of you and submit to you using this bear." Then with a cold look, she shouts, "Fang Yuan let me go. I will forget what you have done to me. Otherwise you will see what my grandma will do to you."

Fang Yuan leans towards Yao Le and seeing that she tries to move away and shouts, "Don't you dare to touch me."

But fang yuan doesn't care about her warning and coldly grabs her cheeks firmly and says, "Such a cute appearance, lovable indeed."

Yao Le is desperately trying to get away from fang yuan. THen fang yuan grabs her upper dress and instantly torn that apart showing her pink undergarment.

Yao Le is stunned, screaming and trying to protect her body from being touch by Yao Le. Now she is 100% sure that fang yaun is going to rape her.

He laughs coldly and continues to pull and tear her clothing apart. Now, she is mostly in her only upper and lower undergarment with a few torn strips of cloth.

She is crying desperately and trying to hide her body from fang yaun. "Don't touch me! Don't come near me. No! Let me go! Let me go!" She is extremely frightened, crying out loudly. As she thinks of all the various possible ways Fang Yuan was going to violate her, her whole body shakes and trembles.

However, he does not continue on as she expected, but instead he stands up and moved backwards.  

Her loud cries turns into sobbing. 

She feels a relief but still sobbing and ponders, "Fang Yuan won't dare to rape her and at best he is trying to make her frightened."

Thinking this Yao Le shouts, "Fang Yuan! You have already taken your revenge and I will not tell anyone about this if you let me go now."
