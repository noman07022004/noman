Fang Yuan faints on the spot. as he has face too many things within too short period of time. Recalling all the terrifying memory of his previous life, then accepting his future demonic self in his despair of previous life's memory. Then again rejecting his future self sensing Fang Sianer. Then his future demonic self forcefully try to kill Fang Sianer by squizing her neck. Then completely gain back control of his mind from his future demonic self sensing fang ma's love. Again falling into grave despair and fear as he had tried to kill fang sianer with his own hand. Still at that point there was no hope martial parasite emitting light of hope around him only deep dark around him despite fang ma and fang sianer are circled by hope martial parasite. The reason why there was no hope martial parasite is that fang yuan has lost all his hope as he gain back the terrorizing memory of his previous life. So no he has no hope left but despite having no hope he has a reason to live and it is his mother fang ma and sister fang sianer. So, he again gain control over his body and also awaken the very first person to awaken the demonic martial core. Before his mind and body can process everything he heard the terrorizing voice as if it is making a conversation with is future self. The voice is so terrorizing that it made his tremble violently and his mind goes blank from the fear of that voice and his whole body and even his bone and his essence and even his mind  tremble from fear hearing this terorizing voice. And so as he feel comfort in  Fang Sianer's arm and Fang Ma's embrace, he faints on the spot.

Time goes by and now it is evening. Fang Yuan is lying in maid room in their mansion. The medicine hall leader along with other medicine hall elder is checking Fang Yuan condition continuously. Fang Sianer and Yao Le are standing near the bed. Fang Sianer is still sobbing and Yao Le is trying to comfort her.

The medicine hall leader who is Yao Le's grandmother says, "Mis Fang Ma, the result is the same. He has no physical injury but his martial core is abnormal. The martial core and martial essence should be while color but his martial core is black color."

With a bit of hesitation, she continues, "As other elders mentioned, his martial core makes me very uncomfortable as I tried to investigate. Just as other elder, I have only able to take a look not fully investigate it."

Fang Ma says, "Okey, thank you. You can go now!"

The medicine hall leader says, "I think he will be fire after some rest."

Fang Ma, "I hope so."

The medicine hall leader says, "Yao Le, lets go! We will come back letter to check on his condition."

Yao Le hesitantly responds, "Grandma, can't I stay here with Fang Sianer."

The medicine hall leader, "You will be no help and only cause troube."

Yao Le responds, "No! I will not. Look at Fang Sianer's condition. She is totally broken and I will take care of her."

Fang Ma says, "Ok! Let her stay. She will be emotional support to Fang Sianer as they are pretty good friend."
