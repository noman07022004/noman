About 7 days has passed, Fang Yuan's condition is as worse as ever. Only responding purely based of instincts. Many Martial Elixirs, Martial Artifacts and Martial Parasite have used but his condition hasn't improved. 

Primarily Fang Ma, Fang Sianer and Yao Le are taking care of Fang Yuan. News about Fang Yuan's condition's hasn't reached to the general public as Fang Ma has prevented them. 

Deep dark circle are visible under Fang Ma's eyes as she is really worried and hasn't slept properly for a single day. She is trying all ways to make fang yuan become normal. No, Martial Elixir, Martial Artifacts and Martial Parasite have done any work. So, she has been trying to find out all ways to Make Fang Yuan normal.

As Fang Ma is sitting beside Fang Yuan looking at his face, she can but cries out as Fang Yuan's face looks very fearful, horrified. Fang Ma strokes Fang Yuan face and hare with all motherly love and affection that she has and then kisses on Fang Yuan's forehead. Suddenly, Fang Ma says, "Fang Yuan's martial core and essence is shadowy black. Which means it will just become more black the more he ranks up. And usually no one injects their primeval essence into someone else's martial core as it pollute the martial core and martial essence which is hard to remove. As Fang Yuan's martial core and essence is black why not inject my martial essence in his martial core. There might a miracle happen."

And so she holds Fang Yuan's hand and then starts concentrating by closing her eyes and then through her hand, she starts channeling her martial essence into fang yuan's body through his hand. As Fang Ma's martial essence starts channeling in fang yuan's body, fang ma ponders, "I have never feel this much close to my son! It feels as if we have become one and it might be because his body is accepting me. Oh my love! Don't worry! Mama will find out ways to help you."

After sometime Fang Ma opens her eyes in fear and jumps backward. She is panting heavily and fear is eminent in her eyes. She ponders, "What was that? As soon as my martial essence went near fang yuan's martial core, I just feel like I have devoured alive and what was this feeling, so terrifying. I have really underunderestemated Fang Yuan's martial core. Before other elders and i just tried to see his martial core and martial essence and observed it from a distance but now that I have get more closer, It feels really terrifying."

Fang Sianer and Yao Le come out after taking bath and fang sianer asks, "Mother, Is there anything wrong." Yao Le asks, "Aunt Fang Ma, is there anything wrong?" Fang Ma responds quickly trying to act normal, "No! Nothing Wrong! Have you tow taken bath properly." They responds, "Yes!"

Another week passes by and fang yuan's condition is still the same with no improvement. During this seven days, all medicine hall elders along with leader have tried their method but nothing has worked and even more when treating Fang Yuan, the all always maintain caution and some doesn't even come back to treat fang yuan because of fear that they felt trying to checking fang yuan's martial core.

Despite the face that fang ma has faced terrified fear and his martial essence devoured by fang yuan's martial core, fang ma tried everyday multiple times despite the horror she face after each time.

Again, Fang Ma jumps backward, her face shows horrified face and panting heavily and her condition has become worse day after day as now she looks like a zombi as fear has permanently sited on her face. 

Fang Sianer cries out, "Mama, please stop! What is going on? Why are you doing this?"

Yao Le also says, "Yes aunt Fang ma, please stop now! today, within a few hours you have tried multiple times and every time you are more fearful and terrified then last."

Fang Sianer shouts crying, "Mama, what actually are you doing? You are saying that you are trying to make brother come back but why aren't you trying to let me do?"

Fang Ma says, "It is very dangerous. I think you already know how dangerous it is from seeing other elders and even leader's terrified and traumatized face."

Fang sianer, "Then why are you doing this?"

Fang Ma responds, "I think if I can understand fang yuan's martial core, I will be able to make our fang yuan come back."

Yao Le, "Then why are you not letting us do it? It would be faster if we all try together."

Fang Ma responds, "No, can't you see how dangerous it is?"

Fang Sianer, "mama, I will be alright. Please let me do one time."

Fang Ma responds strongly, "No! Mean No! If you don't hear my command, I will sent you both to Yao Le's grandmother."
