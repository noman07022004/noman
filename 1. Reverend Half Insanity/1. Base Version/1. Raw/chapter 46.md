They move towards the bed, their steps are quiet. They kneel on either side of Fang Yuan, Their faces are now solemn, mirroring the gravity of the task they are about to undertaken. Suddenly, Fang Sianer whisper, "Will there be any problem if we both inject our martial essence at the same time in him?" Yao Le thinks for sometime and then says, "I think there won't be any problem as I have been checked by multiple elder through their martial essence." Fang Sianer says, "I hope so but you should be very careful as you can recall how the clan leader's condition become after he just injected his martial essence into My love." Yao Le responds, "Yes, I can still recall how fearful he looks and afterward another elder also checked but his condition was the same so no other elders dare to check brother fang yuan" Fang Sianer responds, " mother has been checking brother for a long time and everytime she jumps backward with fearful expression. so, we should be careful. Are you still want to inject your martial essence?" Yao Le responds, "Of course I also want to. Even though I am a bit fearful but I will do it." 

They each holds fang yuan's each hands tightly while intertwining their finger. Then they close their eyes, taking deep breaths, focusing their minds. After a few breath, their martial essence enters fang yuan's body. Both yao le and fang sianer's worry faded away with a satisfied look as they have successfully injected their martial essence without any accident.

They start moving their martial essence towards his heart. As they get close to fang yuan's heart, they start feeling uncomfortable and sweet already starts pauring out of yao le's face but fang sianer looks quite well. 

After sometime as yao le's martial essence touches the surface of Fang Yuan's martial core, Yao Le feels that she is being devoured alive with immense pain. She jumps backward, fearful and panting heavily.

A few breath letter, she checks fang sianer's condition and looks that her condition is pretty well, nothing much has happened. moments passes by quickly but fang sianer is still injecting her martial essence into fang yaun's body and then into his martial core.

Yao le determined again tries to inject her martial essence into fang yuan's martial core but again faces the same consequences. Even though her condition has become worse but she still looks determined, it is as if she is ready to sacrifice herself. 

Then she looks at Fang Sianer for a few breath as fang sianer is holding Fang Yuan's hand with both of her hands. She moves behind fang sianer and then places her both hands of fang sianer's neck and then starts injecting her martial essence into fang sianer's martial core through her body.

As her martial essence passes through the martial core's wall, it becomes green and she feels that she is loosing all control over her martial essence that has entered into fang sianer's martial core. But regrdless as she continues to injects her martial essence into fang sianer's martial core.

After sometime she noticed that even though she looses her control over her martial essence but she can still observe what is his martial essence doing. Then she starts observes that her martial essence that has turned green is also being injected into fang yuan's body and then into his martial core.

But as this time she entered into fang yuan's martial core, she doesn't feels that terrifying fear. Even though she she feels that those martial essence is also being devoured by fang yaun's martial core but even though yao le doesn't feel that terrifying fear and she feels that something within this green martial essence of yao le is pretecting their will and safely making their will retreat.

Suddenly Fang Ma enter's into the room and becomes terrified as she sees fang sianer injecting martial essence into fang yuan's body while yao le is injecting into fang sianer's body. She quickly rushes shouting, "NO!" 

But at that moment, Fang Sianer and Yao Le both open's their eyes and they are panting heavily but satisfaction can be seen in their eyes.

Fang Ma asks desperately while desperately checking fang sianer again and again to see if she is alright, "Are you alright?"

Fang Sianer responds, "No, I am completely fine."

Then Fang Ma looks at yao le and then checks her and asks, "Are you alright as I can see you condition is worse then fang sianer."

Yao Le responds, "I am alright, I am just..." Before she can finish, she fainted on the spot.
