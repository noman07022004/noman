After two weeks letter, Fang Sianer and Yao Le are coming home from academy. Fang Sianer says, "Mama has still not given up and she say she is understanding it more and more." Yao Le responds, "Aunt Fang Ma is really determined." Fang Sianer says, "I want to try at least one time channel my martial essence to My Brother's martial core. Our academy elder has teaches us how to channel martial essence throughout our body and how to control it with our will. But I think I will be able to channel my martial essence into other person too. But I don't want to make my brother at risk so can you help me practice channeling martial essence into other. I know elder has told us that if we channel our martial essence to other's martial core, it will pollute them. But I promise, I will not channel it to your martial core, I will just channel it into your body. Will you help me?"

Yao Le's eyes brighten up and then shouts, "Yes, of course, I was also planning to tell you that but was afraid. Aunt has already sent me back to my house but I really want to help. And don't worry about the pollution. I think you might have forgotten that overtime the pollution would be automatically removed as we uses our martial essence. The more we use it the more quickly the pollute will be removed and it isn't even a big issue as we are the same rank and elder has told that if higher rank martial essence is injected into lower rank martial essence, it takes much more time to clean up but the main point is I don't mind my martial essence being polluted for brother fang yuan's sake."

Fang Sianer embrace yao le on the road and says, "I am really grateful to you. I am really happy having such a friend."

Yao Le responds shily, "What are you doing! We are friends and I also want brother fang yuan to be fine soon and want to check his condition. Then when we are going to practice."

Fang sianer says, "You know, I also have a beautiful personal room but I actually haven't even slept their for a single day how about you stay at our house today. We will start practicing just after going back to our house and after finishing launch."

Yao Le responds, "That is good idea. Let's go your house and grandma has given me this communication martial artifact. I will tell my grandma through this."

Fang Sianer put her hand in her pocket and put it out and says, "Look, I also have one. Mother has given me too."

Yao Le says, "It would have been good if we could store those martial artifact into our martial core just as martial parasite."

Fang Sianer says, "The martial artifacts stops working properly and even more sometime also get destroyed and corroded within a short period if we placed it in our martial core. I think the elder has also mentioned that we can place it in our martial core through many process and one of the most popular is to use any storage type martial parasite and then put the martial artifacts in it and then put the martial parasite in your martial core."

Yao Le responds, "You really were attentive at the time of lecture. I almost forget as those were theory and those lison were giving around 2 weeks ago at our first lecture. Ok, Now let go home quickly."

Fang Sianer responds, "Ok, lets go."

Then they rushes at home quickly and holding each other's hand and there is a strong determination in their eyes.
