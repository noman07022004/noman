Fang Yuan finds himself in very chaotic Battlefield. Thousands of lightning wolfs have attacked their village. The clan members are dying trying to protect the clan by attacking and preventing those lightning wolfs. But he isn't killing any lightning wolfs or protecting their clan. He is hiding in a dark palace and most of the area around was dark as it war night. He sees many clan men died before him and he could have saved them all even without risking his life but he doesn't care. Fang Yuan let them die.

Actually he is observing a girl. The girl is helping who got injured and many were protecting her. This girl is Yao Le. She is at a pretty safe distance and treating those who got injured.

Then Fang Yuan looks at the martial masters who have created 3 laired defense system. The first layer defense is made up with the group of martial masters who is skilled in using defensive martial artifact and martial parasite. They have created a strong defense line so that the lightning wolf tides can't break it. Then second layer is made up with those who are skilled in offensive martial artifact and martial parasite. They are attacking those lightning wolfs who get close to the defense line. And the third layer is made up with watch towers. On top of each watch towers there are multiples martial masters who's work is to collect information and observe the battlefield and use their long range attack to save if someone is in danger. and after all those three layer is medical stuffs who is lead by a young girl yao le. And she is treating those who are injured. She has exceptional healing skilled as she is a highly talented martial master in healing path. And she is also chosen as the successor of the medicine hall.

Fang Yuan observed the defense layer carefully and then the location of Yao Le. After doing some calculation, he takes his position and then launches attacked at the watch tower. Before anyone can understand anything, they died on the watch tower as the attack was devastating and attacked their fatal point.

Then Fang Yuan changes his position and attacked 3 defensive martial master from behind and they also died on the spot as they were heavily concentrated at the lightning wolfs. And even more Fang Yuan's attack was devastating and attacked their fatal point. 

Panic spread quickly there but the offensive martial master starts going all out. Fang Yuan also pretend to go all out with them but starts shouting, "Where is reinforcement?"

An offensive martial master shouts, "There is no one at our watch tower!"

Fang Yuan shouts, "I am going to bring the reinforcement!" Saying so he quickly run away before anyone can responds. After going a few distance, He attacked those offensive martial masters who were desperately attacking those lightning wolfs. As those attacked were from behind and injured their fatal point they all died. Even those survived killed by the lightning wolfs. Then the lightning wolfs violently devour the body of those martial master.

Casualties become escalating as the lightning wolfs has broken through the defense. The battle field becomes very chaotic. But Still Fang Yuan observes the casualties from a safe distance and manipulate the lightning wolf tide towards the medicine camp by sometime attacking martial master or sometimes the lightning wolfs.

Thanks to Fang Yuan's manipulation, the lightning wolf has reached the medicine camp and starts attacking those injured and medicine stuff.

Yao Le, just a moment before was treating injured, is now facing life threatening situation. Her heart freezes as she saw her guard dying before her eyes. She is just a teenager barely 17 and haven't seen any casualties. Her eyes and faces are opened with fear and terror.
