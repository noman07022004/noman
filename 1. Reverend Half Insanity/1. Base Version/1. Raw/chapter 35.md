Suddenly all Hope Martial Parasite starts glowing very brightly and then Fang Ma and Fang Sianer both make shocked face and as they feel that something has been formed within their heart. For that moment, both fang ma and fang sianer become so shocked that they forget about that they were crying. Withing their knowing, they both automatically try to feel it and then they feel it. They both have awaken their martial core. 

Martial core is the source of power of any martial master. I forms within someone's heart. And from their they channel the martial power within their body to use any martial tools or parasites. You can call it second heart. But there is a difference heart always bets and channels blood all over our body to keep us alive. martial core has martial essence which is the source of all martial power and it is in liquid also just like blood. The main difference between heart and martial core is that martial core doesn't have to channel primeval essence all the time like heart rather martial core works like a storage for martial essence. And one can use this martial essence with just their thought.

If someone's martial core get destroyed, then they loses all of their power and become just like a normal mortal theoretically but as they body has gone through changes, they are still very powerful from normal people but still they are treated like a normal mortal by martial master.

As someone's martial core formed, they feel very warmth and peaceful feelings and a deep connection with that martial core. That is why both Fang Ma and Fang Sianer are reacting this ways.

But before they can fully check their martial core they feels that all the hope martial parasite are rushing towards Fang Yuan with astonishing speed despite the fact that all of their light and glow are extinguishing with astonishing speed. Within a few breath the full river of flower which was glowing dim light looses their light and as all the light seems like Fang Yuan is sucking their light out of them and the light are becoming dark and then circling Fang Yuan.

This is a very abnormal situation because dark mean the absent of light. So darkness is just the absent of light. But everyone around can see the dark light. It is as if the dark light is emitting shadows. 

After a few moment all the dark light enters into fang yuan's body and then Fang Yuan feels that something has created within Fang Yuan's heart. Fang Yuan tries to feel what it is and starts investigating by concentrating all his consciousness.

Suddenly, Fang Yuan heard the terrifying voice again, "Look at your pathetic condition. You had succeeded and the merging process also started but for those two, you have failed. It is not like you haven't gain anything. You have gain slight control over your younger self's mind but this is almost non-existence. And the most unexpected things is that your younger self has awaken the demonic martial core."

Forget about checking his martial core, Fang Yuan starts trembling very violently and his eyes and mouth are wide open form fear. Terrorizing fear is written all over his face.

Sensing sudden violent change, Fang ma's heart stop beating for a moment as she suddenly recalls the condition of fang yuan last night. Fang Sianer suddenly cries out as she sense the sudden fear of fang yuan from her embrace as fang yuan is still in her embrace.

Now the cave is now pretty dark as the primary source of light was the river of flower which isn't glowing anymore as if the whole river of flower had died. Only the glowing stones around the wall is emitting dim light.

After a few moments, the clan elders snap out of their trance, exchanging bewildered glances before rushing toward Fang Yuan. An elder bring out a martial lamp and then channel his martial essence in it and then it starts glowing very brightly. The more martial essence he injects, the more bright the light become. Within a few breath, the whole cave light up and then all the elder rush towards fang yuan to check what is actually going on.
