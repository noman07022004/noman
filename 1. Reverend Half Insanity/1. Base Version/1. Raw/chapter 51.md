Just then, Fang Yuan’s eyes flutter open, and he whispers, his voice faint and dry, **"Mmm… W-water…"** Shen Cui reacts instantly, grabbing a nearby mug, filling it with water, and handing it to Fang Ma. **"Thank you, Shen Cui,"** Fang Ma says gratefully. She gently helps Fang Yuan sit up slightly so he can drink more easily. 

But as Fang Yuan’s gaze falls upon Shen Cui and fang zheng, a flicker of a dark memory crosses his mind… he recalls the memories of him how he looks at shen cui with indifference, how he tourchered her as she come to seduce him. And this wasn't much effect but as he looks at fang zheng too much dark memories flood in him instantly and as before seeing those memories he feels those memories and fainted on the spot again.
