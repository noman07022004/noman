Another month unfolds, a tapestry woven with devoted care. Fang Yuan remains the fragile center of their world, meticulously tended to by Fang Ma and cherished by Fang Sianer and Yao Le, who now balance their academy life with their concern for him. Fang Ma’s strict decree keeps their courtyard a sanctuary, a space where Fang Yuan can exist without the triggering presence of unfamiliar faces. The powerful martial elixir Fang Ma administered weeks ago quelled the violent outbursts, leaving a quiet fragility in their wake.

It is a sun-drenched afternoon in their private courtyard, the air fragrant with the scent of blossoms. Fang Yuan, with Fang Ma’s gentle guidance, slowly waters the vibrant flowers. A small, tender gesture follows: he plucks a perfect rose, his hand still bearing the faint tremor, and carefully places it behind Fang Ma’s ear. **"M-mama,"** he whispers, the words emerging with painstaking effort, **"I l-love… y-you."** Tears well in Fang Ma’s eyes, but a soft, radiant laugh, a melody of pure joy, blossoms on her lips. She embraces him tightly. **"My son, my love,"** she murmurs, her voice thick with emotion, **"I know you love me. And I love you so much."** The scars of his recent madness remain etched on Fang Yuan’s face, a permanent reminder of the inner turmoil. And the past month’s relentless worry has left its mark on Fang Ma as well. But in that shared embrace, in the simple act of love, those burdens seem to momentarily lift. Fang Yuan clings to her, a soft sob escaping his lips. **"M-Mama… I am a-afraid…"** Fang Ma holds him closer. **"Don't worry, my love. I am here. You don't have to be afraid. Mama will help you."**

Later, a fragile peace settles between them as they stroll through the garden, watching the delicate dance of insects among the flowers.

The tranquility is broken by the hurried arrival of Fang Sianer and Yao Le, bursting into the courtyard. **"What are you two doing, Mama, my love?"** Fang Sianer asks, a hint of playful accusation in her voice. **"Just enjoying the fresh air,"** Fang Ma replies, smiling. **"Fang Sianer, have you forgotten?"** Yao Le prompts, a mischievous glint in her eyes. **"Oh! I almost forgot!"** Fang Sianer exclaims, and together they produce four colorful lollipops. **"Look, Brother! We brought lollipops for you!"** They distribute the sweet treats, and soon everyone is quietly enjoying them.

Yao Le gazes at Fang Ma, admiration in her eyes. **"Aunty, you look so pretty. Who gave you that flower?"** Fang Ma touches the rose behind her ear, a genuine laugh bubbling up from her chest. **"Oh! I almost forgot about it! Who else but my beloved son, my love, Fang Yuan!"** Yao Le blushes, a soft, dreamy look in her eyes.

**"My love,"** Fang Sianer demands playfully, a hint of jealousy coloring her tone, **"you used to give me flowers too! Give me one now, just like you gave Mama!"** Fang Ma and Yao Le exchange amused glances. Fang Yuan manages a faint smile, though the underlying sadness in his eyes remains. He stands up, searching the flowerbeds, and finds another large, beautiful rose. He plucks it and carefully places it behind Fang Sianer’s ear. **"My Sianer,"** he whispers, his voice still shaky, **"you look gorgeous. I love you."** Fang Sianer beams, throwing her arms around him. **"My love, I love you too!"**

Then, Fang Yuan turns towards Yao Le, his gaze hesitant, unable to meet her eyes directly. He reaches behind a bush and plucks another exquisite rose. Fang Ma and Fang Sianer watch with anticipation, small smiles playing on their lips. Yao Le’s cheeks flush a delicate pink. As Fang Yuan extends his hand holding the flower, it begins to tremble violently. Tears well in his eyes, spilling down his face. His hand freezes, the rose still a short distance from Yao Le’s hair. Yet, the delicate fragrance reaches her. Fang Yuan’s head bows, his gaze fixed on the ground, the silent tears tracing paths on the dusty courtyard floor.

A pang of understanding, sharp and clear, pierces Fang Ma’s heart. _"For the past month,"_ she thinks, her breath catching, _"he never looks directly at Yao Le. And when he does, that flicker of fear… It must be the guilt, the imagined horror. I have to help him understand it wasn't real."_

Quickly, Fang Ma grasps Fang Yuan’s trembling hand, gently guiding it to place the rose behind Yao Le’s ear. **"Yao Le,"** she says, her voice bright, perhaps a little too bright, **"why aren't you hugging Fang Yuan? He gave you a flower!"** Yao Le hesitates, still blushing, but Fang Ma gently pushes her forward. Yao Le hesitantly embraces Fang Yuan. But his own arms remain stiff, as if he is trying to create a distance. Tears now flow freely down his face, the torment of guilt and fear evident in his trembling form. In a shaky whisper, Fang Yuan begins, **"I-I a-am s-sorr…"** The word hangs unfinished, the weight of an imagined transgression too heavy to articulate. What is he truly sorry for? Does he believe he deserves forgiveness for something that never happened?

The afternoon fades into evening, and the servants bring dinner to Fang Yuan’s room. A quiet tension hangs in the air, despite the outward normalcy. Fang Ma, her resolve firm, has Yao Le sit close to Fang Yuan as they look over academy notes, a gentle attempt to reintroduce routine. Yao Le and Fang Sianer share what they’ve learned, patiently including Fang Yuan. But Fang Ma’s thoughts are troubled. _"Even after all this time,"_ she muses, watching Fang Yuan and Yao Le side-by-side, _"the guilt still clings to him. Sometimes, my attempts to reassure him seem to backfire, making him withdraw further. I need a stronger approach."_

**"It's dinnertime,"** she announces, handing out plates. **"Yao Le,"** she says, her gaze steady, **"today, you will feed Fang Yuan. I always do, but today, it will be you."** Yao Le’s eyes widen, a nervous blush rising on her cheeks. **"I-I…"** Fang Sianer starts to volunteer, but Fang Ma gently but firmly shakes her head. Yao Le, her hand trembling slightly, scoops up a spoonful of fried rice and offers it to Fang Yuan. Fang Ma gently nudges the spoon closer. Fang Yuan takes the bite, chews slowly, but when he tries to swallow, his throat seems to seize. The rice feels like a stone, heavy and unyielding. A look of intense discomfort, bordering on panic, crosses his face. He tries again, but his throat constricts, a visible pain flitting across his features. He can’t swallow. His eyes widen with distress, and then, his consciousness slips away once more.

Later, Fang Yuan lies still on the bed. Worry lines Fang Ma’s face, but beneath it, a steely determination remains. Yao Le sits beside the bed, tears silently tracing paths down her cheeks, comforted by a quiet Fang Sianer. **"Yao Le,"** Fang Ma says gently, her voice firm, **"I have told you before, you need to be strong. You know why I wanted you here, close to Fang Yuan."** Yao Le nods, her voice choked with sobs. **"I know… but still…"** Fang Ma sighs. **"I can’t explain exactly why Fang Yuan reacts this way to you, but he believes he has done something terrible. He is consumed by a guilt that isn't his. But we will help him through this."**

Fang Yuan’s frequent loss of consciousness no longer triggers the same level of immediate panic. They have learned this is often his mind’s way of escaping the overwhelming torment. The true horror lies in the moments of madness, the self-harm. Thankfully, those have become less frequent. Now, often, it is just the tears and the trembling.

Suddenly, Yao Le asks, her voice still thick with tears, **"Brother Fang Yuan wanted to go to the academy tomorrow. What will you do, Aunty Fang Ma?"** Fang Ma looks at her, a thoughtful expression on her face. **"Fang Yuan hasn't asked for much these past weeks. If he wants to go to the academy… even though I am worried… I think I will respect his wish. He needs to reconnect with the world."** Fang Sianer’s voice is immediate and protective. **"Don't worry, Mama. I will take care of Brother Fang Yuan."** Fang Ma nods slowly. **"Yes. And I will go with you both. But at the academy… I will watch over you from a distance."**
