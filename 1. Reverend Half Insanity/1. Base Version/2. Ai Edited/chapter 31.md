Fang Yuan sees the memories, a torrent of images flooding his mind, not as a distant observer, but as if he is living them all over again, the pain and joy searing through his soul, **burning him from the inside out.**

He is a lawyer, his name synonymous with justice, his reputation built on helping those facing grave injustice. His heart aches for the downtrodden, and he finds solace and purpose in visiting quiet villages on weekends, seeking out souls in need of a champion, a voice against the darkness that preys on the weak.

In one such village, he hears a story that tears at his heart, a tale of innocence crushed. A girl, her life shattered after her parents’ sudden, tragic death in an accident. Villagers offer what little they can, but she struggles, working odd jobs, her young shoulders burdened with the crushing weight of survival, yet fiercely determined to continue her studies despite the hardship. Her condition is desperate, a stark contrast to the life she once knew, a life stolen by fate.

An old woman, her voice a low whisper, tells him more. _"Her parents, they had good land. Fertile. But the shadows in this village, the local gang… they devoured it all."_ The reason? A fabricated debt, a lie spun to mask their greed. _"They said her father owed them money,"_ the woman scoffs, her eyes flashing with anger. _"Lies! The truth is, the gang leader… he wanted her. When she refused him, refused to trade her dignity for their false protection, they took everything."_ The implication hangs heavy: submit, or be crushed. She, a child then, could only watch, helpless.

He visits her, a young woman with eyes that hold the wisdom of a thousand sorrows, yet still retain a flicker of defiant spirit. She is wary at first, hostile, her defenses high against a world that has shown her only cruelty. But he speaks with genuine kindness, his voice a calm harbor in her storm. He assures her he is a lawyer, here not for judgment, but to help her reclaim what is rightfully hers, to fight the injustice that has stolen her past and threatens her future. The conversation flows, a fragile trust begins to build between them, a shared understanding in the face of overwhelming odds.

He files a case against the gang, a David and Goliath battle in the eyes of the villagers. The legal fight is fierce, the gang’s influence reaching into every corner, but his dedication, his unwavering pursuit of truth, prevails. The gang leader and his cohorts are found guilty, sentenced to prison. Justice, for once, prevails. The girl gets her property back, a small victory against a vast darkness.

She finds him afterward, her face radiant, a genuine smile finally gracing her lips, a pure, unburdened light in her weary eyes. She thanks him, her voice filled with a profound gratitude that touches his soul. Seeing that smile, so bright and untainted by the horrors she has faced, he falls in love. Deeply, irrevocably. He wants to tell her, to ask her to stay with him, to build a life together, but courage fails him. He is a man of words in the courtroom, but before her, his voice catches, his heart pounding. He leaves, the image of her smile, her resilience, etched forever in his mind.

Days later, the image of that smile, the hope in her eyes, drives him back to the village, his heart full of hope, determined to propose. He finds the village in chaos, a scene of unspeakable horror unfolding before his eyes. Five gang members, their faces twisted with malice and a chilling sense of triumphant revenge, are assaulting her, their brutality a sickening tableau. She is desperately fighting, her body straining, trying to break free, even attempting to smash her head against a wall to end her suffering, to escape the nightmare, but they hold her hands, they grip her hair, their cruelty relentless, their laughter echoing in the air like a desecration. **The sound of her screams rips through him.**

A wave of pure, unadulterated horror and blinding rage, a primal scream of fury, washes over him. He pulls out his gun, his hands shaking with a mixture of terror and righteous fury, and shoots every single one of them. He keeps shooting until they are dead, their bodies lying broken on the ground, the air thick with the smell of gunpowder and something far more sickening. **He wants to burn the image from his mind, but it is already seared there.**

He rushes to the girl, his heart pounding with guilt, with a crushing sense of failure. He sees the extent of the damage, understands the repeated, brutal violation she has endured. He scoops her broken body into his arms and rushes her to the hospital, the weight of his failure crushing him. *If only he hadn't left. If only he had stayed. If only he had been there to protect her.* **The guilt is a physical pain.**

Months pass. The physical wounds slowly heal, leaving behind jagged scars. But the mental scars remain, deep and festering. The girl is unstable, the horror too much for her young mind to process. She functions, she goes through the motions of daily life, but when a memory surfaces, when a sound or a smell triggers the trauma, she breaks down, reliving the terror, her screams echoing the ones he heard that day. **He watches her suffer, helpless.**

Then, one day, he decides he cannot wait any longer. He proposes. He kneels before her, a diamond ring shimmering in his hand, a symbol of a future he desperately wants to build with her, his voice filled with a love that transcends the trauma, that sees *her*, the woman beneath the pain. The girl cries out, tears streaming down her face, not of sorrow, but of disbelief, of overwhelming joy, of a fragile hope. She tells him, her voice choked with emotion, that she loved him from the moment he first came to her home, that she wanted to tell him after he helped her, but felt unworthy, a simple village girl with nothing but her small plot of land, land she wouldn't even have if not for him. She had dreamt of finishing her education, becoming a lawyer like him, and then finding the courage to propose to him herself.

But then, the shadows of her trauma resurface, their icy grip tightening around her heart. She cries out, the words laced with self-denial, with the internalized shame that society had imposed upon her. ***"You don't have to show me pity!"*** she sobs, pushing his hand away. ***"I know… I know you're just doing this out of pity, because of what happened! And… and now I'm… I'm like a used product, tainted, broken by men! I don't deserve you! I'm not worthy!"***

He looks at her, his heart aching, his love for her a fierce, protective flame. ***"Who says that!"*** he says, his voice firm, unwavering, cutting through her self-doubt. ***"I have always loved you! From the very first time I saw you, I fell in love with the light in your eyes, the strength in your spirit! And who says you are like a used product? You are pure! You are innocent! You are the victim here! Those men… they were the sickness, the evil, the ones who are tainted!"***

With a defiant gesture, he throws the ring away. It clatters on the ground, a cold, insignificant symbol of societal expectations. He extends his hand, his eyes filled with a love that seeks no validation from material things, only the acceptance of her heart. ***"Do you want to give me the honor… the immense honor… of becoming your husband?!"***

Tears still flowing, but now mixed with a radiant joy, she answers with a joyful sob. ***"Yes! Oh, yes!"***

He speaks again, his voice filled with tenderness, with a promise of unwavering devotion. ***"You deserve the best, my love, the absolute best, and I… I may not be the best man in the world. Still… will you honor me to try my best… every single day… to become a good husband for you?"***

Tears stream down her face, but her laughter rings out, a beautiful, fragile sound of pure joy amidst the lingering pain. ***"Yes! Yes, a thousand times yes!"***

Fang Yuan speaks again, his heart pouring out, his voice a solemn vow. ***"There is no need for a ring to represent our love. Please… please accept my love, all of it, and honor me to become your husband. Let the whole world… the whole universe… all the living and non-living things… be our witnesses! Let them see the love that binds us!"***

She answers, her voice radiant with happiness and love, a declaration of her heart before the cosmos. ***"Yes! I accept you as my eternal love and my husband… before the whole world, the whole universe, and before all the living and non-living beings!"***

He kisses her hand, then gently, reverently, kisses her forehead. In that moment, the pain, the suffering, the trauma – it all fades away, pushed back by the overwhelming power of his love and acceptance. All she feels is his love, his unwavering belief in her worth. She wants this moment to last forever, to be frozen in time. If it is a dream, she wants to be trapped in it for all eternity, never to wake. **Their love is a fragile light in the darkness.**
