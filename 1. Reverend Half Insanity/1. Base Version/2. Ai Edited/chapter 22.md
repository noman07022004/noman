With a blink of an eye, another four years pass. Now Fang Yuan is fifteen, his gaze sharp and intelligent, reflecting a mind that constantly observes and analyzes. Fang Zheng is a lively fourteen and a half, his youthful energy still infectious, his laughter a frequent sound within the mansion. And Fang Sianer, now a thoughtful fourteen-year-old, continues to blossom, her gentle nature a comforting presence to those around her.

During these four years, Fang Ma has solidified her control over all financial matters with an iron grip. Her astute business acumen, honed by the memories of her past life, has led to an unprecedented expansion of their wealth and influence. A new and formidable power has emerged within the village and beyond: the **Fang Faction**.

Everyone, from the Clan Leader to the most seasoned elders, watches in stunned silence as the Fang Faction rapidly establishes itself as a dominant force in the region. No longer confined to the village borders, its influence and business reach far and wide, touching every aspect of life.

Despite her complete lack of martial prowess, Fang Ma has become the most powerful, wealthiest, and influential figure in the region. Her word carries a weight that even seasoned martial masters cannot ignore, her decisions shaping the very fabric of their society.

The days of scheming and manipulating Dong Tu are long gone. He is now little more than a shadow, a servant in his own mansion, a fact widely known but rarely spoken aloud out of a mixture of pity and fear. Dong Tu actively avoids Fang Ma’s piercing gaze, her sharp eyes seeming to see through his very being, leaving him breathless with a nameless, constant dread.

Even the Clan Leader no longer dares to look at Fang Ma with any hint of lust or avarice. Her mere glance is enough to make him feel profoundly uneasy, a disquiet that extends far beyond mere respect for her immense wealth and influence. The exact reason for this significant shift in his demeanor remains a mystery even to Fang Ma herself, though she suspects her carefully cultivated reputation plays a significant role.

Yet, she understands one thing clearly: the Clan Leader harbors a certain apprehension towards her, a subtle fear that she can sense but not fully comprehend. She hasn’t engaged in any overtly threatening behavior; her focus has remained solely on achieving the goals she set for herself years ago. Her unwavering aim is to amass enough wealth, provisions, powerful martial parasites, and precious martial stones to ensure Fang Yuan can overcome his inherent lack of exceptional martial talent.

To achieve this, she has relentlessly expanded her business empire using the innovative techniques she remembers from her previous life. While the initial expansion within the village required careful navigation, strategic alliances, and subtle manipulations of other factions and even the Clan Leader, she has always moved with a balanced approach and unwavering caution, anticipating every potential obstacle.

She has always been acutely aware that her rapid growth would eventually draw the unwanted attention of those in positions of power. To mitigate this risk, she has diligently cultivated a strong reputation among everyone, from the highest elders to the lowliest mortals, earning the revered title, **"Mother of Kindness."** This carefully crafted reputation serves as a potent shield, making potential adversaries think twice, or even thrice, before considering any action against her.

She regularly spends quality time with Fang Yuan and her other children, venturing out into the village and beyond, actively teaching them the value of kindness through practical examples and heartfelt conversations. She pays particular attention to Fang Yuan in these lessons, subtly nurturing his compassionate nature, hoping to counteract the darkness she knows lies within his future.

Through these consistent and loving efforts, Fang Yuan has blossomed into a young man of remarkable kindness and empathy, earning the affectionate title of **"Messenger of Love"** not only from the common villagers who have witnessed his generosity firsthand but also from respected elders and even some of the more jaded martial masters.

This widespread positive reputation has become another powerful layer of protection for Fang Ma and her family. The clan, despite its underlying ruthlessness and self-interest, publicly upholds the values of morality and strong familial relationships. Any overt action against Fang Ma or Fang Yuan by the Clan Leader or other powerful figures would likely lead to widespread unrest and potentially the collapse of the clan’s carefully constructed social order. The immense popularity and respect garnered by both Fang Ma and Fang Yuan make them invaluable assets, far too risky to target without facing significant and potentially devastating repercussions.

Furthermore, the widespread trust in Fang Ma has translated directly into booming business for the Fang Faction, with everyone eager to purchase her high-quality goods and services, knowing they will be treated fairly and with respect. This overwhelming public support fuels her continued and seemingly unstoppable expansion.

A significant portion of the village’s martial masters, drawn by fair compensation and Fang Ma’s impeccable reputation for integrity and fair dealings, now work for the Fang Faction, providing security and managing various aspects of her expanding enterprises. Additionally, she has cultivated a large following of devoted individuals who blindly trust her judgment and would readily defend her, creating a formidable force that acts as an additional shield against any potential threats.

To maintain a delicate balance and ensure continued cooperation, Fang Ma occasionally presents carefully chosen gifts to the Clan Leader and other influential figures, accompanying them with sincere and often slightly exaggerated praise for their contributions, often stating that her humble achievements would not have been possible without their wise guidance and unwavering support. This subtle flattery effectively strokes their egos, fostering a sense of superiority and unconsciously generating positive feelings towards her.

While there were frequent hidden attacks on her business in the early days, subtle sabotage and attempts to undermine her efforts that often came at a significant financial cost, these incidents have become increasingly rare over time. In fact, lately, after she strategically expanded her business beyond the immediate village boundaries, Fang Ma hasn’t encountered even a single veiled threat or any sign of hidden aggression.

The Clan Leader and other elders, who initially made numerous attempts to subtly take over her burgeoning businesses and even resorted to eliminating key figures in the shadows, now display no hostility whatsoever, not even in secret. They have seemingly abandoned their predatory intentions and, in some instances, even appear to be relinquishing portions of their own businesses to facilitate Fang Ma’s continued growth and success.

This sudden and complete cessation of resistance makes Fang Ma intensely careful. Even though everything on the surface appears to be proceeding smoothly and her plans are falling into place, she remains vigilant and cautious. She has already gathered everything that she believes is absolutely necessary to compensate for Fang Yuan's perceived lack of inherent martial talent, amassing a vast fortune and a wealth of potent resources that will enable him to cultivate at a pace faster than anyone else in the clan, ensuring his future power and security.
