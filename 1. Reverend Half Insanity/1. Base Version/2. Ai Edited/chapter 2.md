**At Gu Yue Village, in a distant world...**

Morning light spills through the window, casting a soft glow over the entwined couple on the bed. The man stirs first, his eyes fluttering open to meet the gentle embrace of dawn. His gaze falls upon his wife—her head resting lightly on his arm, her hair fanning out like silk against the pillow. A tender smile tugs at his lips as he whispers, his voice brimming with love, “Oh, my dear… it’s morning.”

The elegant lady opens her eyes slowly, her gaze meeting his. She gives a radiant smile, but there is an unmistakable flicker of worry shadowing her face. "I’m feeling... strange," she murmurs, her words hesitant.

The man—Fang Fu, thirty years old, strikingly handsome with a manly presence that seems destined for heroism—looks at her curiously. “Could it be that we’re finally welcoming a new member into our family?” he asks, his tone laced with both excitement and anticipation.

The young woman—Fang Ma, twenty-five, breathtakingly beautiful, her elegance so divine it feels as though a goddess has descended upon this earth to bestow her love and kindness—lets out a small laugh, though it wavers slightly. “I have this feeling… I think I might be pregnant.” 

But then her laughter fades, replaced by a shadow of worry darkening her features. Her voice drops to a whisper, trembling with unease. “Last night, after we… after you finished, I felt something strange—a sensation I can’t explain. It’s still there, lingering inside me. And then, in my sleep, I heard a cry—a mad, desperate hopeless scream, like someone who had lost everything they ever loved. But now…” She pauses, her breath hitching. “Now I realize this scream wasn’t from a dream. It’s as if it’s echoing all over my body.”

Fang Fu pulls her closer, embracing her tightly. His voice is steady but firm. “Don’t worry, my dear. Nothing bad will happen. I won’t allow it. You’re just too excited—that’s why you’re hallucinating.”

But Fang Ma’s face remains pale. “I can still hear the scream echoing through me. I can’t understand the words, but I can feel the intense pain, the overwhelming hopelessness in that voice.”

Fang Fu tightens his embrace, gentle yet resolute, and presses a kiss to her forehead. Determination etches itself across his features. “It must be because you’re hungry and exhausted. Stay here; I’ll bring breakfast while you rest.”

Deep within Fang Ma’s belly, a formless entity stirs. Its situation is peculiar—it isn’t fully trapped, yet it is bound by something that has yet to take shape. Its voice echoes in the darkness, filled with madness, confusion, and frustration. *“Where am I? Why is it only darkness? Where was I before, and how did I fall here? Why can’t I recall my name?”*

Then it screams, its voice raw and anguished: *“Is there anyone?! Can anyone hear me?! What is my crime? Have I done something wrong? Why can’t I remember anything?!”*

No response comes—only the endless echoes of its own cries reverberating through the void.

**One month later...**

Fang Fu asks Fang Ma anxiously, “Dear, are you still hearing those strange screams?”

Fang Ma looks pale. Though only a month has passed, her belly has already swollen to the size of a six-month pregnancy. Her breathing is uneven, and she frequently feels sharp kicks from within. “No,” she replies softly, “they’ve stopped. I haven’t heard them in weeks, but…”

Before she can finish, a violent kick jolts through her belly, making her entire body tremble. Tears well up in her eyes, but a bittersweet smile graces her lips. “It looks like our baby is blessed by heaven—he’s grown so much that he’s already kicking me. Even though the kicks hurt, I want to feel this pain because it makes me happy.”

Fang Fu watches her with growing concern, his gaze fixed on her pale face. He tries every method to comfort her, but nothing eases the tension in the air.

It’s unusual for Fang Ma to feel such pain. After all, she is a Rank 3 Healing Gu Master, and the power difference between a Gu Master and mortals is staggering. There are nine ranks in total, but those above Rank 6 are considered immortals—a distant dream spoken of only in legends. Practically speaking, there are only five attainable ranks. The power gap between each rank is immense—typically tenfold. This means Fang Ma, as a Rank 3 Gu Master, possesses the strength of one thousand ordinary humans (10 x 10 x 10).

And yet, despite having the strength of a thousand men, she endures excruciating pain. She knows that normal women experience this level of agony during childbirth, but she never imagined she would endure it herself. Still, she bears it willingly, for every pang symbolizes her love for the child growing inside her.

Fang Fu has already consulted doctors from the Medicine Hall about her condition, but what can anyone do when the patient is none other than the current leader of the Medicine Hall, renowned for her unparalleled healing abilities?

With such rapid growth, suspicions arise—some wonder if their child might not be human but a monster instead. But Fang Ma reassures him firmly, declaring that no matter what emerges from her womb, it will be her child, and she will love it unconditionally. With that assurance, Fang Fu silences any doubts, and others dare not question further, knowing full well that Fang Fu himself is a formidable elder.

Inside Fang Ma’s belly, the unborn being muses silently:  
*“I can feel that I’m submerged in some kind of fluid—it must be divine or extraordinarily special. It calms me and fills me with a strange sense of peace and strength. If I could stay in this fluid forever, I believe I’d never go insane. Living within it feels like being in heaven—always full of vitality and energy. But the real problem is that it’s completely dark and unbearably boring.”*

**Another month passes...**

By now, Fang Ma’s belly has swollen to an unnatural size, resembling a towering mountain. She can barely walk, despite her immense strength as a rank 3 Gu Master. Her breath comes in uneven gasps, each one a struggle. **“Fang Fu… I… I don’t know how much longer I can endure this,”** she whispers, her voice trembling with exhaustion.

Fang Fu’s worry is palpable as he watches her, his hands clenched into fists. **“You’re taking the most potent elixirs, the most nutritious foods… yet it’s never enough. What kind of child demands so much?”**

Fang Ma manages a weak smile, her hand resting on her massive belly. **“He’s… special. I can feel it. And no matter what, he’s our child. I’ll give him everything I have.”**

What’s more perplexing is that she has been consuming only the most nutritious foods and powerful elixirs continuously, yet no matter how much she consumes, her baby always seems to crave more.

And even more, she can only breathe properly and avoid violent kicks from her child when she takes the elixirs. It is as if his child is asking for more by kicking her violently. As a result, she consumes them almost constantly, even during sleep. Either her servants or her devoted husband ensure she is fed, as her pain is evident just by looking at her strained expression.
