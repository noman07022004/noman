One year has passed swiftly, filled with joy and closeness. Fang Yuan is now three years old, Fang Zheng two and a half, and Fang Sianer two.

Fang Yuan, playing with Fang Sianer, gently tries to correct her. _"Please say brother, Sianer. Call me brother, not 'my love'."_ Her physical growth is normal, though she remains petite for her age. However, her mental development lags behind.

Fang Sianer and Fang Zheng are engrossed in playing with cute wooden animals, with Fang Yuan watching over them. Fang Zheng now understands simple instructions and communicates basic needs. He recognizes everyone and calls them by name. He calls Fang Yuan _"brother"_ and Fang Sianer _"sister."_ But Fang Sianer still doesn't grasp these familial terms. She babbles, looking at Fang Yuan with an affectionate gaze, _"My love, my love!"_

Fang Yuan throws his hands up in exasperation and calls out to his mother, _"Look, she is still calling me 'my love' instead of brother!"_

Fang Ma responds with a gentle smile, her eyes full of amusement. _"My love,"_ she says to Fang Yuan, mirroring Fang Sianer's words, _"why are you upset? Can't you see I also call you 'my love'? And the reason she calls you 'my love' is quite clear. You used to say, 'My love, oh my love, my dear, call me brother!' So she simply identifies your name as 'my love.' It's endearing, don't worry, my love."_

Fang Fu chuckles, ruffling Fang Yuan's hair. _"Why are you upset, my little tyrant? Don't you like being everyone's 'my love'?"_

Fang Yuan wrinkles his nose. _"It's not that. It's justâ€¦ hearing it from her, who is even smaller than me, makes me a bit..."_

Fang Ma pulls Fang Yuan into a warm embrace, showering him with kisses. _"A bit embarrassed? Ha ha ha!"_

Both Fang Ma and Fang Fu erupt in laughter, their joy echoing through the room. Fang Yuan, however, stamps his foot, a flash of annoyance in his eyes. _"No! Stop right there!"_

Hearing his sharp tone, Fang Ma and Fang Fu immediately cease their laughter, though suppressed smiles still play on their lips. _"Okay, my little tyrant!"_ Fang Fu says, trying to sound serious.

Suddenly, the playful atmosphere is shattered by the hurried entrance of a servant. He rushes in, his face pale with urgency. _"Master, there is an emergency!"_

Fang Fu's expression turns serious in an instant. _"What is the matter?"_

The servant gasps for breath. _"An injured clan man has arrived, bearing orders from the Clan Leader. He is waiting outside."_

Fang Ma and Fang Fu exchange a worried glance before quickly rushing outside, instructing Fang Yuan to look after his younger siblings.

They find a Gu Master leaning heavily against the gate, his robes torn and stained with blood. _"What has happened?"_ Fang Fu demands, his voice sharp with concern.

The injured Gu Master speaks, his voice strained with pain. _"Esteemed Elders, your brother is heavily injured. The Clan Leader and the other elders are desperately fighting off a massive wolf tide. This year, the wolves are unusually ferocious. Many elders are already wounded, and the Clan Leader sent me, after much hardship, to summon both of you to the battlefield as quickly as possible. The Clan Leader gave me a strong order to bring you two back with me. You are the most powerful among us, both in offense and healing."_

Fang Ma immediately steps forward, her healing Gu worms activating, a soft green light enveloping the injured Gu Master. _"Rest now,"_ she says gently as she tends to his wounds. _"Wait here while we prepare."_

Back inside, Fang Fu and Fang Ma stand silently, looking at their children who are playing joyfully, oblivious to the impending danger. Fang Fu breaks the silence, his voice heavy with foreboding. _"I don't have a good feeling about this. You don't have to go. I will go and assess the situation. You stay here with our children."_

Fang Ma turns to him, her eyes blazing with determination. _"No! I know how reckless you can be. To save me when you first saw me first time at the kidnappers hand, you jumped into the thick of the fight, facing even stronger opponents without hesitation despite the fact that you even haven't seen my face and before that fight you even didn't know that I was beautiful or not. I can still remember how gravely injured you were after that battle, almost dead. After the battle ended, You fainted after freeing me, and before losing consciousness, you even shouted at me, **'Hey beauty, I have saved you! If I live, you have to pay me back for all the injuries I have endured for you!'** If it weren't for the fact that I was a healing Gu Master with such a high cultivation realm, you might have died right there!"_

Fang Fu starts laughing, a fond smile gracing his lips. _"Ha ha ha! Now that I think about it, I was truly reckless! Maybe it was because it was you!"_

Fang Ma's expression softens, but her resolve remains firm. _"It doesn't matter now."_

Fang Fu takes her hand, his gaze earnest. _"Don't worry, my love. I will not be reckless this time. I promise I will come back. I have to see our children grow and become great, don't I?"_

Fang Ma places her other hand on his cheek, her eyes filled with a mix of love and concern. _"I will go with you,"_ she declares. _"I will stay behind everyone, ready to heal anyone who gets injured. You know this is a crucial time for the clan; we cannot afford to be selfish. And I believe in you, my husband, my hero!"_

Fang Fu sighs, a mixture of reluctance and acceptance in his eyes. _"Okay, my queen,"_ he says softly. _"As you say. I will protect you, even if it costs me my life."_

Fang Ma gently places her hand over his mouth, stopping his words. _"Don't say such things!"_

They turn back to their children and shower them with kisses, holding them close. Fang Yuan looks up at his parents, his brow furrowed in confusion. _"Father! Mother! Where are you going? And why are you both crying while hugging us like this? Why are you both crying?"_

The scene is indeed spectacular, a poignant display of familial love that would touch anyone's heart.

Fang Ma kneels down, cupping Fang Yuan's face in her hands, her voice thick with unshed tears. _"No, my son! These are not tears! Remember, you are their big brother now. You have to take care of your two siblings while we are away."_

Fang Fu nods, his gaze serious as he looks at his eldest son. _"Yes, my child, remember this in your heart! And if you need anything, ask the servants. We are going out on a very important mission, so we might be late, but we will try to come back as fast as possible."_

Fang Yuan's lower lip trembles. _"Father! Mother! Is it really necessary for you to go? I don't feel good about letting you go!"_

Fang Ma pulls him into another tight hug. _"Don't worry, my son. We will come back soon."_

Then, with heavy hearts but resolute steps, they both take their leave, ordering several trusted servants to remain in the children's room to look after them. Hand in hand, Fang Fu and Fang Ma head towards the battlefield, the weight of their responsibility pressing down on them.
