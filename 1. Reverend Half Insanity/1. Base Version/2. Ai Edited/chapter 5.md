It has been one month since Fang Yuan was born. Despite being just a month old, he can talk and run with remarkable agility. Everyone was utterly astounded when Fang Yuan began articulating words and crawling mere days after his birth.

The reason behind Fang Yuan's rapid development is clear. Although he has been reborn and lost all his memories, his instincts carry the essence of his previous life's experiences. Perhaps his memories are embedded within his instincts, allowing him to learn everything with astonishing speed. His situation is peculiar; he feels that most things are new, yet they are strangely familiar.

Now, Fang Yuan lives like a prince. His mother, Fang Ma, is the leader of the Medicine Hall and a rank 3 Healing Gu Master. His father is on the brink of breaking through to the rank 4 cultivation realm, a feat that threatens the position of the clan leader. They are one of the wealthiest families in the clan, residing in a grand mansion.

Several servants were placed to monitor Fang Yuan and fulfill all his need but Fang Yuan chase them away and only stay with his mother as if he only cares about his mother loves. Fang Ma also feels immense joy seeing how much his little son loves her and stick to her.

At that moment, One Month Old Fang Yuan is at the backyard of the mansion playing on the ground. He isn't playing like a normal child rather like a god with an ant kingdom. He spots an ant far away from it's colony, desperately searching for food to fulfil the hunger of his colony.

Fang Yuan gives a cruel smile yet it looks very cute as he places a pinch of sugar before the ant, his tiny hand hovering like a benevolent deity bestowing a blessing. 

The ant freezes, its antennae twitching in disbelief. Seeing the mountain of sugar before it, the ant excited starts verifying the mountain of sugar by circling it and confirming it again and again. Then it memorizes the location and dances with gratitude towards that god who give it that much food. 

Then, it rushes back to its colony as a messenger of hope for the hungry colony to bring back his fellow warriors from the colony to take back the sugar mountain to their colony to fulfil their hunger.

Fang Yuan's smile changes into more sinister as if he was actually a ruthless demon god in the mask of a merciful god as he slowly takes away the mountain of sugar with is tiny pinch and then place a mountain of salt at the same location with his tiny pinch.

Then he suddenly hears the voice of his mother, the most gentle and loving voice that he always want to hear. *"Oh, my precious son, Fang Yuan! Where are you hiding again? Mama is worried as she can't find you!"*

Fang Yuan's eyes brighten up and with a bright smile he shouts while looking that the mansion, *"Mama! Mama! Come here quickly and look!"*

Fang Ma quickly rushes towards his son and then Fang Yuan points his finger and shouts with excitement, *"Mama! Look here!"*

Fang Ma looks at where Fang Yuan has pointed and then sees some ants are circling the mountain of salt. _"My dear! Are you feeding these ants? How wonderful!"_

Fang Yuan laughs but this laughter don't look innocent but undoubtedly cute. *"Mama! I give a pinch of sugar to that ant over there and then when the ant goes back to its colony to being more warriors to bring back the salt, I replaced it with salt. And now looks how the foolish ants are beating up the messenger ant. He he he."*

Hearing this explanation, she looks at the ants and then says with a gentle and loving smile, *"Oh, my little genius, You are truly brilliant!"*

And then with a worm smile she continues, *"It is time for mink. You must drink, my dear, or you won't grow stronger and won't be able to come up with such brilliant plan."*

The messenger ant is deeply betrayed. He thought that a merciful god has bestow his blessing on him but he found out that it is a cruel demon god waring the musk of a merciful god. Now, the warriors ant are showing questioning him and beating him up for giving them false hope.

Suddenly, with a cruel smile, Fang Yuan uses his thumb finger and mercilessly crush down the messenger ant whom he gives hope.

***It’s like pulling someone out of the abyss, making them believe they are saved, only to tear everything away and crush not just their hope but their very existence.***

Then Fang Yuan launches himself into his mother's waiting arms, his face is bright with innocent smile.

As Fang Ma carries him into the mansion, she gives a gentle and loving kiss at his forehead. *"It is a miracle, a true miracle, how quickly you learned everything! My dear! My love! You are extraordinary. No! You are the MIRACLE!"*

Fang Yuan laughs becomes even brighter as if her words makes him feel great, gives him worm and satisfaction. *"Mama! I am hungry! Let go quickly! I will eat even more milk and you will see how powerful I become!"*

Suddenly, Fang Yuan's gaze darkens and he tightly holds his mother with his tiny hands and says, *"Mama... Mama... You are mine! Mine only! I won't let anyone come near you, not even papa!"*

Hearing these possessive words, Fang Ma recalled an incident from earlier that day. Her husband, Fang Fu, had been departing for his duties that morning and had kissed both Fang Yuan and herself before leaving. Upon seeing his father kiss his mother, their son had become enraged, launching a furious if infantile assault against his father, kicking and punching with surprising force.  
  
When Fang Fu, delighted by what he perceived as spirited liveliness, had attempted to kiss his son's cheek, Fang Yuan had violently grasped his father's beard and hair, pulling with all the strength his tiny body could muster.  

The memory brought a gentle laugh from Fang Ma, unaware of the true nature of her son's possessiveness. To her and her husband, these moments represented the pinnacle of their family life—more precious than any romantic interlude they had shared. The warmth that suffused their souls when witnessing their son's apparent love was beyond anything they had experienced before.  

She smiled radiantly and pinched Fang Yuan's cheek with tender affection. *"Very well, my dear one. Mama belongs only to you. You shall sleep in my arms, and your father..."* she paused, her voice lilting with amusement, *"he shall only watch us from a distance. Does that please my little tyrant?"*

Fang Yuan gives a satisfied smile and hides his face in her chest.
