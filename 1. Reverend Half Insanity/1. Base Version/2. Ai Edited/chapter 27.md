Afterward, Fang Ma asks her children to get ready for the awakening ceremony. A sense of anticipation fills the air. Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng head to another room to prepare themselves, their movements filled with youthful energy. Meanwhile, Fang Ma turns her attention to Fang Sianer. She helps prepare her daughter, carefully dressing her in a beautiful gown that shimmers like captured starlight.

Once Fang Sianer is ready, looking like a delicate angel, her innocent beauty radiating through the room, Fang Ma kneels down before her. She gently takes Fang Sianer's small hands in hers, ensuring their eyes meet, a silent intensity passing between them. _"My little Sianer, my dear,"_ Fang Ma says, her voice soft, but weighted with a hidden layer of worry, _"you know your brother… he is facing some problems, something difficult, like the nightmare he had last night."_

Fang Sianer nods, her young face serious, her gaze unwavering. _"Yes, Mama. That is why last night you told me to sleep with my love, so he wouldn't have nightmares and wouldn't be scared."_

_"Yes, you are right,"_ Fang Ma confirms, a faint, bittersweet smile touching her lips. _"Normally, we sleep separately now that you are older, understanding the physical differences between boys and girls. But from today onward, we must be with my love, my Fang Yuan, every moment we can. I can't tell you the real reason yet, my dear; it is still unclear even to me. But remember one thing: right now, your love is facing a great difficulty, something we cannot see, something that threatens him from the shadows, something we cannot even help directly with our hands. The only thing we can do is support him, stand by him, be his anchor, so that he doesn't break down under the pressure he is facing."_

Fang Sianer’s small hands tighten around Fang Ma’s, her grip surprisingly firm. Her gaze is unwavering, filled with a simple yet profound conviction, a fierce loyalty that belies her years. _"Don't worry, Mama. My love is very brave. Even his title is the Messenger of Love, so nothing truly bad will happen to him. And I will always be by his side, Mama. Always."_

Suddenly, without warning, tears begin to pour from Fang Ma’s eyes, a violent, unstoppable stream she cannot control. The carefully constructed facade of composure shatters. She tries desperately to suppress her sobs, to wipe away the tears with the back of her hand, but they do not stop, flowing freely down her cheeks. A deep, heart-wrenching cry escapes her, raw with a primal fear and sorrow she cannot contain. She pulls Fang Sianer into a tight embrace, burying her face in her daughter's soft hair, clinging to her. _"Woo… woo… my Sianer…" she cries out, her voice thick with pain, muffled against her daughter's shoulder. _"I am feeling my heart becoming empty… hollow. It is as if my heart has started becoming dry, like a once-thriving oasis turning to barren desert. Even taking a single breath feels so empty, so painful, so heavy. Woo… woo…"_

Fang Sianer, though young, her heart pure and empathetic, understands her mother's pain on a level beyond words. She hugs Fang Ma back just as tightly, tears welling up in her own eyes, her small body trembling with shared emotion as she cries out, _"Mama, please don't cry. Nothing bad will happen. Please, Mama, don't cry. We are here."_

Fang Ma’s sobs continue, fueled by the deep-seated fear she feels for Fang Yuan’s uncertain future, the darkness she knows from the novel constantly looming in her mind. __"Woo… woo… I am very worried and afraid about my love, my Fang Yuan. From the very bottom of my heart, I am feeling something… something bad would happen to him. Woo… woo…"_

Fang Sianer, her voice now also thick with tears, repeats her reassurance, her small voice filled with unwavering conviction. _"Woo… woo… Mama, nothing bad will happen, you will see. We won't let it."_

Fang Ma pulls back slightly, her eyes red and swollen from crying, but her gaze is filled with a fierce, protective love as she looks at Fang Sianer. _"My dear, you know the Clan Leader approached me to attend the ceremony, and I agreed. I want to be there to see my children awaken their talent. But I will sit in the elders' place, so I will not be very near to you all. But I will always be looking at you, my loves. You will be at Fang Yuan's side, so please… please take good care of him, no matter what happens. When I look at you, my Sianer, it gives me a spark… a light of hope in this vast darkness I feel surrounding us."_

Fang Sianer, though still sobbing, wipes her own tears away with the back of her hand, her small face hardening with a fierce, unwavering determination. _"Mama! I will always be on his side. Don't worry. I will not let anything happen to my love. I will protect him at all costs! I promise you."_

Suddenly, a remarkable transformation takes place. Fang Ma takes a deep breath, her face hardening with resolve. She quickly removes all traces of tears and pain from her face, wiping them away with a swift hand. Her sorrow vanishes, replaced by a stern, unwavering determination. _"Don't cry before Fang Yuan,"_ she says, her voice firm despite the lingering catch in her breath. _"We cannot show weakness before him, my love. We cannot make him more worried and give him more burden. We need to be strong for him. We need to support him, to be his rock."_

Just then, the door opens, and Fang Yuan enters the room, looking handsome and composed in his new attire, completely unaware of the emotional exchange that has just taken place. Seeing Fang Yuan, Fang Ma’s face instantly transforms. A bright, cheerful smile replaces her recent tears, her voice light and joyful, a perfect facade of maternal happiness. _"My love,"_ she exclaims, her voice filled with affectionate admiration, _"you look really gorgeous!"_

But Fang Sianer doesn't say anything. Her fears are still raw, her protective instincts heightened. She simply jumps towards Fang Yuan and hugs him tightly, her small arms wrapped around him, clinging to him, refusing to let go. It is a hug filled with unspoken fears, fierce loyalty, and a silent promise of unwavering protection.

After a moment, Fang Zheng comes into the room, his face heavy, a subtle sadness still clouding his expression. Fang Ma notices it immediately, her maternal instincts always attuned to her children's moods. _"My dear Fang Zheng,"_ she says gently, kneeling down to be at his eye level, her expression soft with concern. _"Is there something bothering you? Don't hide it from Mama. If you hide it, it will grow bigger and bigger inside and will only make you more sad."_

Fang Zheng hesitates, his gaze flickering away from his mother’s. He shuffles his feet slightly, his hands nervously fidgeting with the hem of his new robe, before speaking, his voice quiet and tinged with shyness. _"Mama… I heard Yao Le is only thirteen, but she is participating in the awakening ceremony."_

_"Yes, my dear,"_ Fang Ma confirms, her voice gentle and understanding. _"Her grandmother, the medicine hall leader, requested it from the Clan Leader, and he allowed it. Is there something on your mind about that? Please tell me, my love. Mama will help you."_

Fang Zheng hesitates again, taking a deep breath, the words tumbling out in a rush, his voice barely above a whisper. _"Actually… Shen Cui is also thirteen and wants to go to the awakening ceremony with us. And… and actually, Mama… I also want to go to the academy with her, if you could somehow… Mama…"_ His voice trails off, his gaze fixed on the floor, avoiding eye contact, his face flushing with shyness and hope.

Fang Ma kneels before him, gently taking his hands in hers, trying to meet his gaze, her heart softening at his shy request. _"My dear, is that it? Oh, you should have told Mama before! But don't worry, my dear, it is a simple matter, easily resolved."_ She smiles warmly, her eyes filled with love. _"Go and ask her to quickly get prepared. She is attending the ceremony with us. Both the ceremony and the academy, my love. Just like you wished."_ Her heart softens at his shy request, knowing how much it means to him. _"Are you happy now, my dear Fang Zheng?"_

Fang Zheng looks at Fang Ma with wide, astonished eyes, unable to believe how easily his wish, his secret hope, has been granted. Then, with a joyful shout, he jumps and throws his arms around Fang Ma, hugging her tightly, burying his face in her shoulder. _"Mama, you are the best! You are the best in the whole world!"_

_"Okay, okay, my dear,"_ Fang Ma says, hugging him back, a wave of warmth washing over her. _"Go and quickly tell her to get ready, otherwise we will be late for the ceremony!"_ Fang Zheng, his face beaming with happiness, quickly rushes out of the room, eager to share the good news with Shen Cui.

After a moment, Mother Shen rushes into the room, her expression a mixture of excitement, apprehension, and disbelief. _"Mistress,"_ she says respectfully, her voice trembling slightly, _"should I… should I prepare Shen Cui as well? For the ceremony?"_

_"Haven't my Fang Zheng already told you?"_ Fang Ma replies with a gentle smile, her eyes filled with warmth.

_"Yes,"_ Mother Shen says, her voice filled with disbelief, almost a whisper. _"But… is it real? Is she truly allowed to attend the ceremony? And… and the academy?"_

_"Yes, it is real,"_ Fang Ma confirms, her tone leaving no room for doubt, her gaze steady. _"Shen Cui is also like my children, Mother Shen. And more importantly, Fang Zheng likes her very much. How could I possibly leave her behind on such an important day, a day that means so much to him?"_ Mother Shen’s eyes well up with tears, and she bows down before Fang Ma repeatedly, her voice choked with overwhelming gratitude. _"Mistress… thank you… thank you for your kindness… your generosity."_

Fang Ma’s smile remains, but her voice holds a hint of her earlier sternness, a gentle but firm reminder of their understanding. _"Haven't I already told you not to behave like this before me? I dislike such excessive displays of gratitude. We are family, in a way."_ She softens her tone slightly. _"Now, go and prepare her quickly! We mustn't be late."_ Mother Shen nods quickly, a tearful smile on her face, and rushes out of the room to get Shen Cui ready, her heart overflowing with a profound sense of joy and indebtedness.
