The next morning, a soft light begins to filter through the windows. Fang Ma awakens very early, the events of the previous night still heavy on her mind. She rises quietly and makes her way to the kitchen. Today, she has planned to prepare many delicious dishes, a special feast for her children, with a particular focus on Fang Yuan. Servants are already bustling about, ready to assist her. Even as she meticulously chops ingredients and stirs pots, her gaze often drifts, her focus not entirely on the task at hand.

_"I have thought over this matter all over the night,"_ Fang Ma ponders, her mind a whirlwind of theories and anxieties. _"I think I have missed some important details, perhaps crucial ones. I only skimmed through that novel before abandoning it, revolted by the cruelty. So, I don't truly know a single definitive thing about the original Fang Yuan's past, beyond vague recollections. I vaguely remember that the Fang Yuan in the novel was betrayed by everyone he had believed in – the clan, his uncle and aunt, and even his little brother, Fang Zheng, whom he loved very much. If I recall clearly, Fang Yuan was saying he just heard a voice, and it said something like 'how pathetic, getting rejected by your own naive self.' After making many theories, after turning it over and over in my mind all night, I have come to a potential conclusion: perhaps the Fang Yuan of the future, his demonic self from the novel, somehow managed to travel back in time. But… but my love, my Fang Yuan, rejected him. Maybe it was because of the future self's demonic nature. I have given so much love to my love, my Fang Yuan, poured all my heart into raising him with kindness and compassion. So now, he is a very kind, compassionate, and pure soul. And because of that, his soul must have rejected his future self."_

She feels a sense of conviction about this explanation, a feeling deep in her heart that it is correct. But a new, unsettling question arises. _"But why was it said in that way? 'How pathetic you are… getting rejected by your own younger naive self.' The voice sounded as if someone else was looking down on the future self, ridiculing him. It couldn't have been the words of his future self, the one who supposedly traveled back in time. There must be something else going on, something I can't comprehend, even after trying so hard. Maybe my love misheard the voice, maybe his fear distorted it. But I have a feeling… a strong feeling… that he heard it right, and something truly fishy is going on."_ Her resolve hardens, her focus sharpening. _"But no matter what happens, no matter what forces are at play, I will never allow my love, my son, my Fang Yuan, to be taken by anyone else, not even his own future self, if that future self is indeed demonic. Fang Yuan isn't the Fang Yuan of the novel. He is another individual entirely, a kind and loving soul who is my child. He is mine."_

After completing the cooking, the kitchen filled with the delicious aroma of the special dishes she has prepared, Fang Ma takes a deep breath and makes her way to the room where they all slept last night. Fang Yuan, Fang Zheng, and Fang Sianer are still sleeping soundly, their presence a comforting sight. Fang Sianer and Fang Yuan are sleeping embracing each other, little Fang Sianer's arms wrapped around her brother, their heads close together. Seeing this, a gentle laughter escapes Fang Ma’s lips.

_"The bond between these siblings, especially between Fang Yuan and Fang Sianer, is truly deep,"_ she ponders, a wave of profound happiness washing over her. _"I am feeling really happy to see them like this."_ She carefully checks Fang Yuan’s condition, watching his chest rise and fall evenly, the tension gone from his small face. She sighs a deep sigh of relief; he looks completely fine now. Then she bends down and gently kisses Fang Yuan’s forehead.

Her gaze lingers on Fang Sianer, and her thoughts turn to her youngest daughter's unique ability. _"I don't need to worry about Fang Yuan's condition as much as I thought,"_ she realizes. _"I have gotten practical results of Fang Sianer's power before. Simply her presence is enough to make someone calm down and regain their confidence. So, as Fang Sianer is holding Fang Yuan, my love would undoubtedly draw strength and recover quickly from whatever terror he experienced."_

With her heart filled with love and reassurance, Fang Ma gently begins to wake her children. She rouses them with soft whispers and tender touches, guiding them towards a nearby basin of warm water. She helps them clean their faces and hands, preparing them for the day ahead. Then, she gathers them around, the delicious aroma of the morning feast filling the air. With her own hands, she begins to feed them, carefully selecting bites of the special dishes she prepared, her focus especially on Fang Yuan, her love and care evident in every gesture.
