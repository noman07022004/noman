It is late at night, the mansion quiet except for the low hum of energy artifacts keeping the rooms at a comfortable temperature. Everything is proceeding as it should be, a deceptive calm masking the desperate plan about to unfold. Fang Ma, driven by a mother's unwavering love and fueled by sheer willpower, remains steadfast in her vigil. She continues to try, every few hours, to understand Fang Yuan's martial core, a terrifying endeavor that has left her physically and emotionally exhausted.

In Fang Sianer's room, a different kind of intensity fills the air. Fang Sianer and Yao Le sit face to face, holding each other's hands, their fingers interlocked in a firm grip. Their eyes are closed, their brows furrowed in deep concentration. They are practicing channeling martial essence into each other's bodies and even, more daringly, into each other's martial cores, having agreed that the potential risk of pollution is a price they are willing to pay for Fang Yuan's sake.

Suddenly, both of them open their eyes, a shared smile passing between them, a silent acknowledgment of their success. Yao Le speaks first, her voice filled with wonder and a growing confidence. **_"Sister Fang Sianer,"_** she says, **_"haven't I told you before that your martial essence doesn't even pollute my martial core? The first time you channeled your martial essence into my body, I understood that your essence is… special. The elders have checked my martial core multiple times, and I know how different your essence feels. Others' martial essence feels a bit uncomfortable, as if someone else has entered your protected territory. But as your martial essence channeled through my body, I felt a sense of peace, calmness… and also, I'm feeling that my body, overall, has become stronger. Even my martial essence in my martial core has become denser, which indicates I may have a breakthrough to the rank 1 middle stage soon."_**

Fang Sianer responds, her own eyes widening with surprise and hope. **_"Really? That's… that's incredible news, Yao Le! And now that I think about it, your martial essence hasn't polluted my martial core either. I think… I think it has no effect on my core at all. It just flows through me like… like water."_**

Yao Le, unable to contain her excitement, claps her hands together. **_"Forget about all those things for now, Sianer! The main point is that we both can channel martial essence into the other's body, and we can control it with our minds! I am really confident that I can channel my martial essence into brother Fang Yuan's body without any errors! What about you? Are you sure you can do it too?"_**

Fang Sianer nods, her face radiating determination. **_"I am also confident, Yao Le! I am sure that I will be able to do it without any errors!"_**

Yao Le leans forward, her eyes bright with anticipation. **_"Then when are you planning to execute the plan? When do we help brother Fang Yuan?"_**

Fang Sianer considers for a moment, then smiles. **_"We will go now, Yao Le. Mother must be exhausted; she has been pushing herself to the breaking point. We will prepare a hot bath for her, a truly luxurious bath, and… we will _force_ her to take it before going to bed. We need her to be rested."_**

Yao Le nods in agreement, a mischievous glint in her eyes. **_"This is a perfect plan, Sianer! Let's execute it!"_**

A short time later, in Fang Yuan's room, the air is heavy with unspoken tension. Fang Ma is sitting beside Fang Yuan, her face pale and drawn, attempting once again to assess his condition, to peer into the terrifying darkness of his martial core. Suddenly, as her essence touches that void, she recoils violently, jumping backward from the bed with a gasp, her face a mask of pure terror. She is panting heavily, her body trembling, her eyes wide with a primal fear she can’t control. _"No matter how many times I try,"_ she thinks, her mind battling her instinct, _"no matter how much experience I gain, it doesn't work. I was completely prepared to not feel fear this time, to at least not jump back… but I have already jumped backward. It looks like experience doesn't work against instinct. It's as if my instinct jumps backward no matter how much I try to be calm, to reason myself out of it."_

From beside her, Fang Sianer suddenly speaks, her voice filled with concern. **_"Mama, please, look at your condition. You must not have eaten properly, and you are over-doing yourself. You need to rest, Mama. Please, take some rest."_**

Yao Le adds her voice, her tone gentle but firm. **_"Aunt Fang Ma, here are some fruits. They are really delicious; we both have eaten them. Please, have some."_**

Fang Ma shakes her head wearily. **_"I have eaten dinner, my dears. I am alright."_**

But Fang Sianer will not be dissuaded. She picks up a piece of fruit and gently places it at Fang Ma's mouth, urging her to eat. **_"Mama, you look so tired. And look at your condition! You are panting and sweating. You should take a shower, a nice, long, relaxing shower."_**

Yao Le nods in agreement. **_"Yes, Aunt Fang Ma, you will feel so much better if you take a shower. All that tension will wash away, and… and you might be able to make more progress with brother Fang Yuan after taking a shower. You will be refreshed."_**

Fang Sianer, her voice persuasive, adds, **_"Mama, we have prepared a hot bath for you in the main bathroom. A really relaxing bath. You should go and take it, please. You deserve it."_**

Fang Ma looks at both of them with suspicious eyes, sensing a subtle tension in the room, a hidden undercurrent to their insistence. **_"I am alright,"_** she repeats, but her voice lacks conviction.

Yao Le presses on, her face filled with worry. **_"Aunty, you are not alright! Look at your condition! We can't see you like that. You are wearing yourself down! You will not be able to help brother Fang Yuan if you do not take care of yourself."_**

Fang Sianer, her voice trembling slightly, shouts, a desperate plea in her eyes. **_"Please, Mama! I can't take this anymore! Brother isn't waking up, and now you are becoming like this! What should I do? Why aren't you taking care of yourself!"_**

Fang Ma looks at both of them again, her sharp eyes scrutinizing their expressions, searching for any hint of deception. The worry in their eyes seems genuine, their concern for her wellbeing sincere. But a nagging unease still remains, a feeling that something is not quite right.

Fang Sianer, seeing her mother's hesitation, her suspicion, makes one last, desperate attempt to convince her. **_"Please, Mama,"_** she begs, her voice filled with tears, **_"for brother's sake! If you don't care for yourself, you won't be able to help him!"_**

Yao Le echoes her plea, her voice soft but filled with urgency. **_"Aunty… please."_**

Seeing their unwavering insistence, their genuine concern, and exhausted and emotionally drained, Fang Ma finally relents. She sighs, her shoulders slumping with weariness. **_"Okay… okay, my dears. I am going to take a quick bath. I will… I am counting on both of you to look after Fang Yuan while I am gone. Promise me you will call me if anything happens."_**

Fang Sianer, relieved, smiles warmly. **_"You don't have to worry about brother, Mama. We will take care of him. You please take a proper bath, a long, relaxing bath, without worrying about anything else. We will be right here."_**

Yao Le nods enthusiastically. **_"Yes, Aunt Fang Ma! We have taken care of brother Fang Yuan for two weeks now; we know how to take care of him. And we will immediately call you if there is any… any movement from brother Fang Yuan. We promise."_**

Fang Ma again looks at both of them with suspicious eyes, her heart still whispering a warning, a feeling that something is amiss. But she is too tired, too desperate for a moment of respite, to argue any further. She ponders, _"I must have been too tired and overdoing myself. I am even starting to suspect these two's good will. They are just trying to help, and I am acting as if… as if they are my enemy."_ She forces a smile, trying to shake off her unease.

Fang Ma nods slowly, her voice filled with a weary trust. **_"You are right. I am going. I am counting on both of you. Please… be careful."_**

They respond together, their voices ringing with earnestness, a shared determination in their eyes that melts away the last of Fang Ma's resistance. **_"Please take a proper bath, Mama. A long one. You can count on us."_**

Fang Ma watches them for a moment longer, the subtle unease still whispering at the back of her mind, but the exhaustion is too great, the need for respite too strong. She sighs, a sound of weary surrender, and with a final, worried glance at Fang Yuan's still form, she turns and leaves the room, heading towards the main bathroom, leaving the two girls alone with the sleeping boy.

The moment the door closes behind Fang Ma, the atmosphere in the room shifts. The pretense is gone, replaced by a quiet, focused intensity. Fang Sianer and Yao Le exchange a look, a silent communication passing between them. Their earlier weariness seems to vanish, replaced by a fierce resolve.
