A month passes swiftly. A natural and endearing pattern has formed within the family. Fang Yuan remains possessive of Fang Ma. Fang Zheng has become deeply attached to Fang Fu. And little Fang Sianer shows a clear preference for Fang Yuan.

Their sleeping arrangement reflects this unspoken bond. Fang Ma sleeps in the middle of the bed. On one side, nestled close for nighttime feeding, lies Fang Sianer. On the other side sleeps Fang Zheng. Fang Fu always positions himself beside Fang Zheng, taking extra care of his seven-month-old son. Fang Zheng’s first articulated word, spoken with a sweet babble, was indeed _"Papa."_

Fang Yuan, now a sturdy one year and one month old, has transitioned to eating normal food. Yet, he still seeks the comforting warmth and nourishment of his mother’s milk whenever he desires. He sleeps beside Fang Sianer, a silent guardian watching over his little sister.

Throughout this past month, Fang Yuan has dedicated most of his time to Fang Sianer. An undeniable connection has blossomed between them. In her presence, Fang Yuan finds a unique sense of peace, a tranquility that eludes him elsewhere. He has, in his own innocent way, become quite obsessed with his little sister.

The morning light streams gently into the room. Fang Yuan is already engaged in play with Fang Sianer. Her growth, however, is noticeably slower than that of other children, and even Fang Zheng. Her size, too, is petite compared to babies her age. Yet, she is perfectly healthy, her small body radiating a vibrant energy.

Nearby, Fang Fu is playfully engaging with Fang Zheng, making a series of funny faces and enthusiastically repeating, _"Say Papa! Papa!"_ He is also gently supporting Fang Zheng as he attempts to take a few wobbly steps. While Fang Yuan was running and speaking fluently at the tender age of one month, Fang Zheng, at seven months, has not yet displayed any such extraordinary feats. He has just begun to try crawling and hasn't yet mastered standing, let alone walking. His vocabulary is limited to simple, often repeated words like _"Papa"_ and _"Mama,"_ along with a few other common sounds he hears.

Fang Sianer lies contentedly on the bed. Fang Yuan is fully focused on her, making silly faces, showing her colorful toys, and gently tickling her with his hands and face, trying to coax a laugh from her. She responds with delighted gurgles and smiles, clearly enjoying his undivided attention. _"My princess! My love!"_ Fang Yuan exclaims, his voice filled with affection. _"Call me brother!"_ Fang Sianer simply laughs, her eyes sparkling.

Fang Yuan turns to Fang Ma, who is attentively monitoring everyone, offering assistance where needed. _"Mama!"_ he asks, a hint of frustration in his voice. _"You told me that I started saying 'Mama' on the very day I was born and began having proper conversations within a week."_

Fang Ma smiles gently. _"Yes, my dear."_

_"Fang Zheng has already said 'Papa' first, and then 'Mama',"_ Fang Yuan continues, his brow furrowed in confusion. _"But why isn't Fang Sianer saying 'brother' to me, even though I've been trying to teach her for a whole month? You told me that if I kept saying it, she would call me 'brother' within a month. Why isn't she?"_

_"Be patient, my love,"_ Fang Ma says soothingly. _"She is still very young. And look at your little brother. He started saying 'Papa' around seven months, but he still can't articulate it perfectly every time. He might be closer to ten months before he can say it clearly all the time. But listen to him babbling, 'papapapapapapa.' He isn't truly saying 'Papa' with understanding yet; he's mostly just repeating the word he hears most often. So, continue your hard work, my dear. She is only one month old. What do you expect from her? She will likely start babbling around six months, as normal children take six to nine months to start babbling."_

_"Mama, I am tired,"_ Fang Yuan whines, a hint of exhaustion in his voice. _"Give me milk!"_

Fang Ma gently pulls Fang Yuan into a warm embrace, showering him with soft hugs and kisses. _"My dear,"_ she says, her voice filled with tenderness, _"you have been trying so hard for a whole month. You even refused your morning meal and have been continuously working at it. You have such good strength and determination. Okay, finish eating slowly and to your heart's content. You need energy for all your hard work! Ha ha."_

_"Okay, Mama!"_ Fang Yuan declares with renewed determination. _"I will eat very much, and you will see! I will make her call me 'brother' even before she says 'Mama' and 'Papa'!"_

Seeing Fang Yuan’s unwavering resolve, Fang Ma gives him a gentle, loving smile and offers him her breast. _"My dear!"_ she says, her eyes filled with affection and pride. _"You definitely will!"_


A year has almost passed. Fang Yuan is nearing his second birthday. Fang Zheng, at one year and five months, has learned to walk, though he still stumbles when trying to run. He has also begun forming meaningful sentences and can understand simple conversations. Meanwhile, little Fang Sianer, at eleven months old, has yet to speak. She can understand simple communication that is created by simple gesture but only responds with babbles. However, she has already learned to crawl, eagerly exploring her surroundings.

Fang Fu places a reassuring hand on Fang Ma’s shoulder. _"Don’t look so worried, my dear. Everything will be okay."_

Fang Ma hesitates, her lips pressing together. _"I’m not worried, it’s just that..."_

Fang Fu smiles knowingly. _"I understand. But instead of worrying, you should celebrate. Our children are extraordinary. Look at Fang Sianer—her physical growth is normal, and though her mental development seems a little slower, she is completely healthy. And Fang Zheng—everything about him is perfectly on track. You’re only feeling uneasy because you've grown used to seeing so much abnormality. Now that things appear normal, it feels strange to you."_

Fang Ma exhales, a soft chuckle escaping her lips. _"You’re right. I was overthinking again."_

Not far from them, Fang Yuan is playing with Fang Sianer as she crawls across the floor. He leans in close, his eyes shining with excitement. _"My love, call me brother! Please say it, my love!"_

Fang Sianer giggles, clapping her tiny hands. _"Mmmmyyy... loooloo... vevveve..."_

Fang Yuan puffs out his cheeks and turns to Fang Ma, a hint of frustration in his voice. _"Mama! She hasn’t called me brother even once! You said it would only take a few more days, but she still isn’t saying it!"_

Fang Ma smiles warmly. _"Don’t lose heart, my dear. The moment she says it for the first time, you’ll feel an immense joy like never before. Just keep asking her gently."_

Determined, Fang Yuan turns back to Fang Sianer, cupping her soft cheeks in his small hands. _"Say ‘brother’! Please, my love, my dear! Just once, please!"_

Fang Sianer babbles again, her eyes twinkling with innocent amusement. _"Mmmmyyy... loooloo... vevveve..."_

Nearby, Fang Fu, who has been playing with Fang Zheng, glances toward Fang Ma. _"Your idea is excellent. We’ll hold the welcoming ceremony next month."_

Fang Ma nods, her expression resolute. _"Yes. Fang Yuan will be almost two years old, Fang Zheng will be one year and six months, and Fang Sianer will turn one. We’ll send invitations to everyone—the clan leader, the elders, and all the important members. Not just that, we will feast for seven days and include the entire mortal village outside."_

Fang Fu chuckles, admiration evident in his gaze as he looks at Fang Ma. _"As you say, my dear. It will be grand—worthy of our children."_
