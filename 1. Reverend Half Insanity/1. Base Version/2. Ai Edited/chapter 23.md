Days rush by, each one bringing the awakening ceremony closer. Only seven days remain.

Fang Ma sits on the floor of their room, a bowl of warm rice and meat in her lap, gently feeding Fang Yuan, Fang Zheng, and Fang Sianer with her own hands. _"Only seven days left until the awakening ceremony,"_ she says, her voice soft and filled with anticipation. _"Are you all feeling prepared?"_

Fang Yuan, his mouth full, chews thoughtfully before replying, _"Mama, I am ready. But Fang Zheng and Fang Sianer aren't fifteen yet."_

Fang Ma smiles reassuringly. _"Don't worry, my love. I spoke with the Clan Leader, and he has declared that from this year onwards, anyone above the age of fourteen can participate in the awakening ceremony."_

Fang Zheng’s eyes light up with excitement. _"Mama, I will awaken a high talent, you will see!"_ he declares confidently.

Fang Yuan nods in agreement. _"Mama, I will too!"_

Fang Sianer, still happily munching on her food, chimes in, her voice slightly muffled. _"Yes, my love will awaken high talent!"_

Fang Yuan looks at Fang Sianer, a gentle smile on his face. _"You will awaken great talent too, My Sianer,"_ he reassures her.

Fang Ma sets the bowl aside, her expression becoming serious. _"Yes, my children, I believe you will all do wonderfully. But there is something very important I need to tell you all."_

Fang Yuan swallows his food and asks, his curiosity piqued, _"What is it, Mama?"_ Before answering, Fang Ma gently places another bite of rice and meat into Fang Yuan’s mouth. _"Talent isn't everything, my loves. No matter what talent you awaken, it doesn't truly matter. What matters most is that you are my children."_

Fang Yuan chews thoughtfully, then adds with unwavering confidence, _"But Mother, you will see, we will all awaken high talent."_

Fang Ma reaches out and gently strokes Fang Yuan’s hair. _"My love,"_ she says, her voice filled with tenderness, _"whether you do or you don't, it makes no difference to my love for you. You are my loves, and you will always be, regardless of the outcome. Remember, Mama will never be disappointed in you."_

Fang Yuan looks into his mother’s eyes, his own filled with determination. _"Don't worry, Mama. I will not disappoint you."_

Fang Sianer, in her own unique way of showing affection, has wrapped her arms around Fang Yuan’s neck from behind. Now, she starts gently pushing him forward and backward in a playful, if slightly odd, manner. When Fang Yuan doesn’t actively engage in her games, she often resorts to this gentle, yet sometimes surprisingly forceful, pushing. _"Mama,"_ she shouts, her voice filled with conviction as she pushes Fang Yuan again, _"my love will awaken the best talent, you will see!"_

_"My Sianer, please stop,"_ Fang Yuan pleads, his voice slightly strained. _"I can't chew properly."_

But Fang Sianer, caught up in her enthusiasm, instead shakes Fang Yuan more vigorously, her voice even louder as she addresses Fang Ma. _"Mama, my love will awaken high talent, you will see!"_

Seeing their unwavering resolution, a soft sigh escapes Fang Ma’s lips, a mixture of amusement and a slight resignation. She had hoped to fully convey that their talent held no bearing on her love and acceptance, but their young minds were clearly set on proving their worth.

Fang Ma offers water to Fang Yuan and the others, her worry still subtly visible in her eyes. _"Let's go for a walk outside,"_ she suggests, hoping to distract them.

Fang Zheng immediately objects, his face falling slightly. _"Mama, Shen Cui and I wanted to play that new game this afternoon. Can't we go another day?"_

Fang Ma looks at him, her expression thoughtful. _"If you want to stay, you don't have to come, my dear. But are you sure? You haven't been going outside much lately."_

Fang Zheng shrugs. _"Shen Cui and I also go with Mother Shen to help others sometimes. So, don't worry, Mama."_

Fang Ma’s gaze softens as she looks at Fang Zheng, a sudden realization dawning on her. _"It looks like I have been too focused on Fang Yuan lately and haven't given proper attention and compliments to Fang Zheng,"_ she thinks, a pang of guilt in her heart. _"As a result, he has become attached to Mother Shen, who readily compliments him in front of Shen Cui, which clearly makes him happy."_ 

She smiles at Fang Zheng. _"Okay, my dear Fang Zheng. If that is what makes you happy, I don't mind at all. Go and enjoy your game."_
