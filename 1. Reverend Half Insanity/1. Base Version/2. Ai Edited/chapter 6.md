The world is swallowed by the black of night, a silence so deep it hums. Inside a room with a weak light, Fang Yuan lies on Fang Ma’s lap. His small body snuggles close to her warmth. She speaks softly, teaching him useful things about the world, but he already knows – fairy tales make him sleepy. Instead, his eyes shine brightly whenever she talks about Gu Masters and Immortals.

_“There are nine levels of power,”_ Fang Ma says, her voice soft but strong. _“Levels one to five are called Gu Masters. From level six upwards, they are known as Gu Immortals. And those at level nine…”_ She stops, her eyes looking far away. _“They are called Venerables.”_

**Fang Yuan’s eyes burn with excitement.** He sits up quickly. _“Mother, are you a Venerable?”_

Fang Ma laughs softly, her lips making a gentle smile. _“Level six and above are legends, my dear. No one even knows if they truly exist.”_

**Fang Yuan’s tiny fists clench tightly.** His voice is fierce, full of strong belief. _“Even if they don’t exist, I will make them! I will go beyond them all! You will see, Mother!”_

A look of surprise flashes across Fang Ma’s face before it changes to pride. She bends down and kisses his forehead warmly. _“Yes, my son… You will do it. Mother believes in you. You will become a MIRACLE!”_

Just then, the door bursts open. Fang Fu steps in with a loud laugh, his presence filling the room. _“My little prince is already a miracle, isn’t he?”_ He walks over quickly and lifts Fang Yuan easily into his arms. _“Born in only three months, walking and talking in one! Truly, he goes against heaven itself!”_

He spins Fang Yuan in the air, his deep laughter shaking the room. _“Oh, my son! You are my whole world! People once called me a genius, the chosen one, meant for great things. And I believed it… until you were born!”_ His grip tightens, his eyes burning with love and deep admiration.

Fang Ma stands up from the bed, coming to stand beside them. She puts a hand on Fang Yuan’s back, her look playful but full of pride. _“Then doesn’t that make you extraordinary too? After all, you are the father of such a son!”_

Fang Fu throws his head back and laughs loudly. _“You’re right!”_ He leans in and kisses Fang Yuan’s cheek firmly. At the same time, Fang Ma does the same, kissing his other cheek.

Fang Yuan bursts into laughter, his small body shaking from so much love. **But then—**

Fang Fu freezes. His lips stay pressed against Fang Yuan’s cheek, his expression suddenly changing, like he has just found something very precious.

**A moment later—**

_“AH!”_ Fang Yuan cries out sharply, pulling away. His small hands push against Fang Fu’s chest, his laughter gone.

Fang Ma’s smile disappears instantly. Worried, she pulls Fang Yuan into her arms. Her eyes widen in shock as she sees the small, red mark on his cheek where he was bitten.

Her voice becomes sharp, full of a mother’s anger. _“Fang Fu! Look at what you have done to my precious child!”_

Fang Fu scratches the back of his head, giving an awkward smile. _“I swear, I didn’t mean to! His cheek was just too soft… I couldn’t stop myself!”_

Silence. **Then—**

Fang Yuan stares angrily at his father, his tiny lips making a pouty face. Fang Ma sighs, shaking her head. But even though she looks serious, a hint of amusement twinkles in her eyes.

Fang Fu, realizing he is in trouble, reaches out with a shy smile. _“Come on, my little prince… Don’t be angry.”_

Fang Yuan huffs, turning away dramatically. But after a moment, a mischievous spark flashes in his eyes. He suddenly jumps forward—**biting Fang Fu’s nose!**

_“AHH! YOU LITTLE DEVIL!”_ Fang Fu yells, jumping back.

Laughter explodes in the room. Fang Ma shakes her head, holding Fang Yuan close as she chuckles. The night is filled with warmth, love, and the sounds of playful chaos.

Time flows quickly, like a river that never stops. Before they know it, the night has become deeper, and it is time for bed. But while the world becomes quiet, Fang Yuan’s mind is still busy – not because of the earlier bite, but by the heroic story of his father.

Lying comfortably between Fang Ma and Fang Fu, Fang Yuan looks completely happy. His small body is warm between them, his eyes shining with curiosity. Fang Fu, always wanting to make them happy, starts another story, his voice rich and full of life.

_“Once, I was traveling through the dark mountain to go to a special party,”_ Fang Fu begins, his voice dramatic. _“Everything seemed normal, but deep down, I felt it – something about that night was different.”_ He leans in a little, his face serious. _“The mountain was dangerous, full of wild beasts. But your father? Hah! Fear has never touched me!”_

Fang Yuan listens very carefully, his small hands holding the blanket tightly.

_“Then, in the middle of the night, I heard a noise,”_ Fang Fu continues. _“I could have ignored it, walked away like a careful man. But no! I followed it! And what did I find? A group of bad people had captured a beautiful girl.”_ His voice becomes quieter. _“She fought to free herself, but she was alone. There were too many of them.”_ His fist clenches. _“I couldn’t stand it. My blood burned with anger! And so, I ran in, beat every single one of those villains to the ground, and saved her.”_

Fang Yuan’s eyes widen. He grabs his father’s sleeve. _“Who was she?”_

Fang Fu smiles widely, turning to Fang Ma. _“It was your mother.”_

Fang Yuan gasps, turning quickly to look at Fang Ma. _“Mother! Is it true?”_

Fang Ma smiles gently, touching his cheek. _“Yes, my dear. I was very scared… I thought the worst would happen. But then, your father appeared – like a hero in the story – and saved me.”_

Amazement shines in Fang Yuan’s eyes. **He claps his hands together.** _“Father, you are amazing! You saved Mother!”_

Fang Fu lets out a happy laugh, clearly very pleased with himself. He leans down and kisses Fang Yuan’s forehead firmly. _“Of course! Your father is extraordinary! So extraordinary that people can’t help but be jealous! Hahaha!”_

Feeling proud, Fang Fu stretches out his arm, reaching towards Fang Ma with a playful smile – **only to be stopped suddenly.**

Fang Yuan jumps forward, grabbing his father’s hand with surprising strength. His little face becomes serious. _“No!”_ he shouts, his voice fierce. _“Mama is mine! Only mine! I will protect Mama! Go away!”_

Fang Ma laughs loudly, hugging Fang Yuan tightly. She kisses his forehead, her voice full of warmth. _“Yes, my little tyrant. Mama belongs to you now.”_ She looks at Fang Fu with playful mischief. _“Did you hear that? I am my son’s now. He will sleep in my arms, and you will watch from far away. Are you happy, my little tyrant?”_

Fang Yuan smiles happily, showing he has won. _“Yes! Father, did you hear that? Don’t you dare come near Mama! I will protect her!”_

Fang Fu chuckles, raising his hands to show he gives up. _“Yes, yes, my king! As you command. Mama is yours alone.”_ He moves back a little, pretending to be defeated, but amusement dances in his eyes.

Fang Ma shakes her head, smiling. _“Alright, my little protector, now that Mama is yours… it’s time to sleep.”_

**But just as she settles down—**

_“Mama!”_ Fang Yuan whines, his small hands pulling at her. _“I’m hungry! I want milk!”_

Fang Ma blinks, then laughs. _“Ah! I completely forgot – my little tyrant only sleeps while drinking mama's milk! Hahaha!”_

She holds him close, warmth filling her heart. As Fang Yuan drinks, his small body relaxes, his eyelids becoming heavy until sleep takes him.

The room becomes quiet and peaceful. Fang Fu watches, a gentle smile softening his usually loud face. **These small moments – this playful chaos, this simple warmth – are the most precious things of all.**

As Fang Ma carefully pulls the blanket over Fang Yuan, Fang Fu leans in and kisses her forehead softly. Their eyes meet – warm, tender, filled with quiet love.

**And just like that, under the soft light of the night, the family drifts into sleep, wrapped in the comfort of being together.**
