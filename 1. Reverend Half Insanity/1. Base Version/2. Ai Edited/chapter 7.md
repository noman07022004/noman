The first rays of the rising sun paint the eastern sky with hues of gold and rose, swiftly pushing back the shadows of night. In the warm embrace of his mother, Fang Yuan stirs awake. For a fleeting moment, the innocence of childhood graces his features. Then, his eyes narrow, a sudden hardness replacing their earlier softness. His gaze falls upon a hand resting possessively on his mother’s arm. Slowly, deliberately, he turns his small head. A storm of complex emotions churns within him as he sees his father, Fang Fu, sleeping soundly beside them, his own hand casually draped across Fang Ma. Looking at his father’s face – **bright, handsome, heroic, and undeniably manly** – Fang Yuan feels a surge of purely negative feelings. It isn't hate, not yet, but a profound, instinctive yearning to possess his mother entirely consumes him. The fear of losing her love grips his small heart, casting his father as both a rival and a formidable threat in this silent, internal battle. Already, in his young mind, he **has declared that Fang Ma belongs solely to him**. And remarkably, they have agreed: **Fang Ma _is_ now completely his, and Fang Fu _has_ no right to even touch her.** The childlike innocence vanishes from Fang Yuan’s face, replaced by an expression of intense frustration and anger, a turmoil of complicated feelings swirling within his young soul. He _has_ warned his father, _has_ claimed his mother as his own, yet his father’s casual touch is a blatant disregard of his decree.

Then, a sharp sensation cuts through his dark thoughts – the unmistakable pressure of a full bladder. Usually, he would simply call for his mother’s assistance. But now, as he gazes at his father’s heroic sleeping face, a dark and sinister plan begins to take shape within his young mind. Silently, he slips out of his mother’s embrace and stands, his small body radiating an unnerving stillness, his gaze fixed intently on his unsuspecting father. With a grim determination that belies his age, he uses his tiny hands to forcefully pry open his father’s mouth. His movements are deliberate, his focus absolute. He fumbles with the buttons of his pants, pulling them down with practiced ease. Then, with careful precision, he positions himself. His small penis, which he internally refers to as his _‘tiny dragon’_, is aimed directly at his father’s gaping mouth. He takes a deep breath, gathering all his strength, preparing to unleash the contents of his bladder with every ounce of power his small body can muster. After a tense moment, the charge is complete. With a sudden, powerful surge, the pee erupts from his _‘tiny dragon’_ with surprising force and speed, as if it could indeed pierce the heavens, aiming precisely into his father’s wide-open mouth.

Fang Fu jolts awake, his eyes snapping open as a warm, forceful flood fills his mouth and nose. The sensation is shocking, disgusting, and utterly unexpected. **Steam actually rises from his face**, a testament to the surprising warmth of the urine. He coughs and spits, his hands flying to his face in a desperate attempt to wipe away the foul wetness. Scrambling upright, his eyes frantically scan the room until they land on a jar of water. He snatches it up and frantically rinses his mouth and face, the cool liquid bringing a wave of relief as the unpleasant sensation begins to dissipate. Fang Yuan watches his father’s frantic movements with a wide, satisfied smile stretching across his face.

Fang Ma stirs awake, her eyes fluttering open to the commotion. Fang Fu, still slightly sputtering and wiping his face, manages to explain the unbelievable situation to her, his voice a mixture of shock and disbelief. Fang Ma’s eyes widen momentarily as she takes in the scene, her gaze then shifting to Fang Yuan. A flicker of surprise crosses her face, quickly followed by a softening of amusement. She reaches out and pulls him into a warm hug, showering his head with kisses. _“My sweet little one,”_ she asks gently, her voice laced with a hint of laughter, _“why do you do that? You always wake Mama to help you go pee.”_ Fang Yuan looks up at her, his small face serious and resolute. _“Because Papa touches Mama, even though I tell him not to. And he agrees that Mama is mine only, and Papa will just watch from far away.”_

Hearing this innocent yet possessive explanation, both Fang Fu and Fang Ma are utterly shocked into silence. They exchange a speechless glance, a mixture of surprise and disbelief passing between them. Then, Fang Ma throws her head back and laughs loudly, the sound echoing through the room, hugging Fang Yuan even tighter and showering him with more kisses. _“Oh, my little tyrant,”_ she says, her voice brimming with love and amusement, _“you are truly something else! But Mama is very happy.”_ She glances at Fang Fu, her eyes sparkling with mischief and a hint of challenge. _“How can you disobey the order of our tyrant, my dear husband?”_ Fang Fu is still slightly stunned, a bemused expression on his face. Something like this _has_ never happened to him before. From a very young age, he _has_ possessed incredible talent, and his life _has_ always felt like a hero's journey in a fairy tale. Even though this situation is utterly unexpected and somewhat disgusting, a warm feeling begins to spread through him as he watches Fang Yuan holding his mother so closely, a strange sense of protectiveness welling up within him for his fiercely possessive son.

Fang Ma looks down at Fang Yuan, her expression softening into one of sweet understanding. _“Oh, my little tyrant,”_ she says gently, _“if Papa ever disobeys this rule again, you must tell me immediately, and you will see how Mama punishes your Papa for not following our tyrant's rule.”_ Then, turning her playful gaze to Fang Fu, she asks sweetly, _“What do you say, my dear husband?”_ Fang Fu laughs, a genuine, hearty sound, looking at Fang Yuan who is also looking back at him with a triumphant glint in his bright eyes. _“Okay, my king,”_ he says with a warm smile, his voice filled with affection, _“please forgive me. I won't dare disobey my tyrant's order again.”_ He reaches out and gently takes Fang Yuan into his arms, pulling him close. _“Are you happy now, my tyrant?”_ Fang Yuan nods, his small face still serious but with a hint of satisfaction in his eyes. _“Yes, Papa, if you don't touch my Mama, it will be okay.”_

This chaotic moment, filled with unexpected actions and heartfelt reactions, forges an unbreakable bond between them all. **These are extraordinary moments in Fang Ma’s and Fang Fu’s lives, moments that will be etched into their memories forever, bringing them warmth and making them smile whenever they remember the day their little tyrant king asserted his peculiar dominance.**
