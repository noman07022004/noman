**Another month later...**

Fang Ma’s condition deteriorates further. Her once radiant skin now appears sallow, her breaths shallow and labored. She resembles a shadow of her former self—hollow, as though the life is being drained from her with each passing moment. Yet, nestled deep within her belly, she feels a faint presence—a warmth that radiates calmness and fills her with an inexplicable sensation of peace. It’s this small gift, this quiet reassurance, that keeps her tethered to hope. Without it, she knows her body would have succumbed entirely, despite possessing the strength of a thousand ordinary humans.

But the baby’s kicks are relentless—each one a sharp, searing pain that tears through her like jagged lightning. They leave her gasping for air, clutching at the sheets beneath her trembling hands. Every movement inside her feels like both a blessing and a curse: proof of life yet a torment too great to bear.

Fang Fu rarely leaves her side, his face etched with worry so profound it seems to age him overnight. “You’re strong,” he whispers hoarsely, gripping her hand tightly as another wave of agony washes over her. His voice cracks under the weight of his fear, but he forces himself to sound steady—for her sake. “You’ll get through this.”

Within her womb, the unborn child’s thoughts churn with raw determination. *“I don’t care if I live or die. I just need to get out of this place. This endless darkness… I can’t take it anymore. If it weren’t for the fluid surrounding me, I might have gone insane by now. I will go all out—right now.”*

It is night, and the room is bathed in soft moonlight filtering through the curtains. The shadows dance gently across the walls, creating an illusion of serenity that contrasts sharply with the storm raging within Fang Ma. Fang Fu sits beside her, his every action tender and deliberate. He adjusts her pillow carefully, ensuring she finds even a sliver of comfort. Then, with gentle hands, he begins massaging her back, feet, and legs, trying to ease her pain, bring her relief, and offer some semblance of peace.

Despite his efforts, the tranquility of the moment shatters when Fang Ma suddenly cries out—a guttural, heart-wrenching scream that pierces the silence. Hearing her cry, Fang Fu’s heart skips a beat. In all the months of her pregnancy, she has never let out such a sound. Her breathing becomes erratic, shallow, as though she cannot draw enough air into her lungs. 

In her anguish, she violently grabs his hand, her grip surprisingly weak yet desperate. Tears stream down her pale face as she struggles to speak. “If I… don’t make it…” Her voice trembles, barely audible. “Please… don’t blame our… child! Please… love him…”

The words strike Fang Fu like a dagger to the chest. For the first time in his life, the man who has always exuded strength and confidence breaks down. Silent tears stream down his face, his shoulders shaking as he clutches her hand tighter. Never before has he felt such suffocating despair, such overwhelming helplessness. And then, amidst his grief, he recalls her earlier words: *“I heard a cry—a mad, desperate, hopeless scream, like someone who had lost everything they ever loved.”* 

At that moment, those haunting words echo in his mind, and he realizes—they were not just about her dreams. They were a premonition of what was to come.

Fang Ma lies in the position she adopted long ago—the only posture that offers her any semblance of relief. But even that fleeting comfort fades as her condition worsens with each passing second. The pain becomes unbearable, consuming her entirely. Yet, seeing the devastation on her husband’s face, she summons every ounce of strength left in her frail body. With immense difficulty, she forces herself to speak, her voice barely a whisper. “P-please… don’t… blame… our… child… Give… him… the love… of both… father… and moth…”

Before she can finish, an excruciating wave of pain crashes over her, more intense than anything she has ever endured. It feels as though her very soul is being torn apart from the inside. Summoning every last shred of energy, she pushes with everything she has, while the baby charges forward with violent determination. Finally, with one final, earth-shattering effort, the child emerges into the world.

For a brief moment, Fang Ma feels nothing but relief—a profound, indescribable sense of satisfaction that washes away all traces of pain. She forgets the agony, the exhaustion, the fear. All she feels now is the gentle touch of tiny hands and legs brushing against her skin. Each movement sends waves of love coursing through her veins, filling her with a joy so pure it transcends words. Her lips curve into a faint smile, her eyes shining with unshed tears of happiness.

But Fang Fu remains frozen, still trapped in the throes of trauma. His mind replays the horrors of the past few hours—the cries, the desperation, the thought of losing her. The room is shadowy, the moonlight casting long, dim shapes across the walls. He doesn’t yet notice the relief on Fang Ma’s face or the fact that she has already given birth. His world is still consumed by the fear of losing everything he holds dear.

Fang Ma’s weak but radiant smile breaks through the shadows of the room as she gazes at her newborn child. Her trembling hands reach out, gently cradling the baby’s tiny form. Each movement of the child—every flutter of their fingers, every soft kick of their legs—fills her with an indescribable warmth. The pain, the exhaustion, the fear—it all fades into the background, replaced by an overwhelming flood of love and relief.

**“Dear…”** she whispers, her voice soft but filled with joy. **“Look… our child. Our precious child.”**

But Fang Fu is still paralyzed, his mind trapped in the moment of her agonized cry. His hands shake as he clutches hers, his breath uneven. It takes a moment for her words to register, for the reality to sink in. Slowly, his gaze shifts from her face to her arm where she is holding a quite healthy baby.
