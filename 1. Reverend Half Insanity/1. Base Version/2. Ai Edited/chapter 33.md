Around twenty years later, a lifetime etched in the lines on his face and the emptiness in his eyes, he has established an organization. Its members are lawyers and detectives, dedicated to a singular purpose. He is no longer a civil lawyer, defending the innocent in minor disputes, but a criminal lawyer, specializing in cases of sexual violence and abuse, his focus narrowed to the darkest corners of humanity. There is no smile on his face, not a flicker of warmth. His eyes are like the gaze of death itself, cold and empty, devoid of any spark of life. He is a living corpse, walking through the world, haunted by the past. He goes to the graves of his wife and daughters every day, a silent vigil, a broken man paying homage to his lost world. His organization, named after his wife and daughters, carries their memory, their suffering, its primary goal to prevent any other girls and women from facing the same horrific fate that his wife and daughters endured.

This change, this new purpose, this grim dedication, came to him one night in a dream. His wife and daughters appeared to him, their faces radiant, telling him they were happy in heaven, and asking him to prevent other women from suffering as they had. In their memory, in their plea, he found a new goal for his broken life, a reason to continue existing in a world that had taken everything from him.

Many decades pass, the years blurring into a long, agonizing journey. He grows old, his body failing, his condition worse than ever. Initially, he found a fleeting sense of happiness, a flicker of purpose, a temporary balm for his wounds, in helping others, in his organization bringing justice to women and girls who had faced injustice. He saw the gratitude in their eyes, the small victories against the darkness. But as days turn into years, a chilling, soul-crushing realization dawns on him: no matter how many criminals he punishes, how many monsters he locks away, new ones emerge, their brutality escalating as if they are in a perverse race to surpass the previous horrors, to break the boundaries of human depravity. **The darkness is endless.**

He established his organization to be a shield, to prevent other girls and women from facing the fate of his wife and daughters, to create a world where such horrors could not exist. But he discovers, with agonizing, soul-crushing certainty, that he cannot prevent it. He cannot stop the darkness from consuming innocent lives. At best, his organization can only provide justice *after* the brutality has occurred, a cold comfort in a world filled with suffering. **He is fighting a losing battle.**

He sees countless girls and women, some older, some the same age, and even some younger than his daughters, endure the very same horrors, the same unspeakable brutality. He sees the dead bodies of women and girls, victims of violent rape and brutal murder, their broken forms a chilling echo of his wife and daughters. Each sight tears open the wounds in his soul, making him relive the nightmare with agonizing clarity. **The pain is constant, a living hell.**

No matter how hard he tries, how much he sacrifices, how many battles he wins, he cannot stop men from committing these acts of brutality. He cries for hours, silent, tearless sobs that shake his very being, that tear at the remnants of his soul, the wellspring of tears having dried up long ago, leaving behind an arid wasteland of pain, as he witnesses the broken spirits and shattered lives of the women and girls who survive the horror. **His soul is a desert of despair.**

He loses his sanity completely, the overwhelming darkness of the world, the unending cycle of brutality, consuming him entirely. He becomes convinced, with a chilling, absolute certainty, that men are the source of all evil, the murderers, the rapists, the perpetrators of this unending brutality. If men did not exist, there would be no evil, no suffering of this kind. He descends into a complete, irreversible madness, seeing any man as a monster, a potential threat, a symbol of the darkness that stole his family. If he sees a man, any man, he charges at him, his eyes filled with a terrifying, singular purpose â€“ to exterminate him, shouting, his voice a broken echo of his past, ***"Rapist! Murderer!"*** His mind, shattered by trauma and the unending cycle of violence, has reduced the complex world to a single, horrifying truth: men are the enemy, the source of all suffering, and they must be eliminated. **He is consumed by hate.**
