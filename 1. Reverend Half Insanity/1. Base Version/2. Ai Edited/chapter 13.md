The welcoming ceremony officially begins, ushered in by the warm, heartfelt words of Fang Fu and Fang Ma. Their voices, rich with joy, resonate through the courtyard as they address the gathered clan members and villagers.

With dignified poise, the Clan Leader, Gu Yue Bo, ascends the elevated platform where Fang Fu and his family are seated. Fang Fu and Fang Ma greet him with respectful nods. A brief exchange of pleasantries follows before Gu Yue Bo presents his gift. Since Fang Fu and Fang Ma have their hands occupied with Fang Zheng and Fang Sianer, a servant steps forward, carefully opening the ornately adorned box. Inside, cushioned on a bed of velvet, rests a lustrous, dark stone.

"Thank you for this valuable gift," Fang Fu says sincerely, his gaze lingering on the object.

An elder in the first row suddenly exclaims, "This is a defensive artifact! It is said to withstand even a blow from a Rank 5 Gu Master! Truly an invaluable treasure!"

A murmur of admiration sweeps through the crowd. The Clan Leader’s generosity is praised in hushed tones. Such a rare artifact—something most would never part with—underscores his wealth and influence. Gu Yue Bo puffs out his chest ever so slightly, reveling in the acknowledgment. Though reluctant to part with such a valuable item, he knows this display only strengthens his standing.

But before anyone can fully absorb the moment, a small hand darts forward like a striking viper.

With uncanny swiftness, Fang Yuan snatches the dark stone from Fang Fu’s grasp. He turns it over, his sharp eyes scrutinizing every angle. "Okay," he declares, his voice carrying across the courtyard. "It looks good, and it's glowing a little. I can play with it with Fang Sianer."

A ripple of laughter spreads through the guests at the innocent remark. But amusement quickly dissipates when Fang Yuan’s gaze lifts, locking onto Gu Yue Bo with unnerving intensity.

"Why only one?" he demands, his small brow furrowing. "Where is one for my little brother Fang Zheng? And for my little sister Fang Sianer? And for my beautiful mother?"

Fang Fu’s smile tightens as he attempts to placate his son. "My dear, this is a very generous gift. You must not speak so. Say thank you."

Fang Yuan’s voice rises, clear and unwavering. "You are the Clan Leader!" he exclaims. "Are you so poor that you can’t afford more? How disappointing!"

The courtyard plunges into stunned silence. The lively atmosphere vanishes, replaced by a thick tension. Guests shift uncomfortably, casting wary glances at one another, uncertain of how to react. Gu Yue Bo’s face stiffens, his earlier satisfaction crumbling into a mixture of humiliation and disbelief.

Fang Ma hastily steps in, her voice coated in forced warmth. "Don’t mind Fang Yuan," she says with a strained smile. "He is young and naive." She shoots Fang Yuan a warning look. "Don’t say such things, my dear."

Fang Fu follows quickly, adding, "Please, Clan Leader, do not take offense. Let’s enjoy the ceremony."

Gu Yue Bo, still reeling from the child’s audacious words, struggles to compose himself. Had an adult spoken such words, he would have known exactly how to respond. But this—this was unprecedented.

He takes a step back, intending to retreat to his seat and let the matter pass. But before he can escape, Fang Yuan’s voice cuts through the thick air once more.

"Why are you running away?" the boy calls after him, his small form radiating defiance. "Don’t you have anything else for my little brother Fang Zheng?"

Every eye in the courtyard snaps toward Fang Yuan. Even Fang Fu—whose strength alone posed a potential threat to the Clan Leader’s position—had never dared to speak to him in such a manner.

Gu Yue Bo halts, his back rigid. He inhales deeply before turning, pasting a smile onto his face. With deliberate slowness, he retrieves a storage Gu worm from his sleeve—a seemingly ordinary object, yet one of immense value.

As he reaches for it, intending to present additional gifts, Fang Yuan moves like lightning. Before anyone can react, the boy snatches the storage Gu from Gu Yue Bo’s grasp.

"I am taking this on behalf of my mother and father!" Fang Yuan declares triumphantly, gripping the Gu worm tightly.

A collective gasp ripples through the crowd.

Gu Yue Bo’s expression flickers between shock and barely restrained panic. "That… that is very important to me, young master," he says, struggling to maintain composure.

"Fang Yuan, give that back this instant!" Fang Ma commands, her tone sharp. Even Fang Fu intervenes, his voice laced with urgency. But Fang Yuan does not budge, his fingers wrapped around the Gu worm like a vice.

Seeing the tension thickening, Gu Yue Bo forces a magnanimous smile. "No, no," he says, waving a hand. "Let him have it. The young master seems to have taken a liking to my old storage Gu worm. No need to trouble him further."

The gathered guests barely suppress their disbelief. The Clan Leader—willingly parting with such a valuable treasure to a mere toddler? Unheard of!

Still, Gu Yue Bo isn’t finished. Turning to Fang Fu and Fang Ma, he speaks with careful precision. "However," he pauses, his smile still in place but tinged with a sharper edge, "there are some irreplaceable artifact. Would it be too much to ask if young Fang Yuan allows his grand-uncle to retrieve a few sentimental items?"

Fang Yuan considers this. After a long pause, he gives an exaggerated sigh and nods, as if granting a great favor.

Gu Yue Bo approaches, subtly manipulating the Gu worm as he extracts a few select items. Though he manages to reclaim some irreplaceable treasures, he knows that a significant portion of his wealth remains in the boy’s hands.

The silence in the courtyard is deafening.

Gu Yue Bo, his face a mask of forced serenity, slowly returns to his seat, his earlier pride utterly shattered.

Seeing this blatant act of extortion, the guests hesitate. No one dares approach the platform to present their gifts. Fang Fu, sensing the shift, signals to his servants. "Collect the gifts from the guests."

Servants move swiftly, gathering offerings from guests who carefully avoid making eye contact with Fang Yuan. The elders, in particular, shrink back, fearful of becoming the next target of the boy’s demands.

What began as a joyous ceremony ends on an unsettling note. Though the feast continues, an unease lingers. The image of a child openly humiliating the Clan Leader is seared into their minds—a tale that will be whispered through the generations.

For Gu Yue Bo, the loss is staggering. The storage Gu contained a fortune—spiritual stones, rare herbs, powerful Gu worms—worth over a hundred thousand spiritual stones. 

It is a very devastating blow not only at his wealth but also at his honor and pride.
