***"Sir! Please, return it immediately! You’re strictly forbidden from reading those reports!"***  

A young female lawyer shouts respectfully at an old-looking man. Though barely fifty, he carries the aura of someone a century old, standing at death’s door. If anyone glances at him, they would feel only pity. His eyes are hollow, sunken deep into a face etches with endless hopelessness—as if despair itself has taken human form.

Ignoring her pleas, the old-looking man scans the report in mere breaths, absorbing every detail, every word with terrifying speed. Despite the lawyer's frantic attempts to stop him, even going so far as to snatch it away and tear it apart, she fails. He has already read everything.

***"No! This is bad!"*** she screamed silently in her mind, panic gripping her chest.

The next moment, the old man begins clawing at his head and face with trembling hands, his voice erupting into a guttural roar:  
***"NO! NO! NOT AGAIN! NOT AGAIN!"***

Hearing his sudden shouts and screams, the young female lawyer's heart stops for a moment but the next moment she starts trying to calm down the old man. ***"Sir, please! You need to breathe—"***  

But his screams only grow louder, more desperate. ***"YOU WILL FACE THE SAME FATE! THE SAME FATE!"*** His voice cracks, raw and ragged, as he pounds his fists against his skull. ***"NO! NO! I CAN’T LET IT HAPPEN... CAN’T LET IT... FIGHT THEM! FIGHT THEM!"***  

His expression shifts suddenly, as if a memory has surfaced, a memory so horrifying it makes him recoil. He slams his fists against his head, over and over, as if trying to beat the hopelessness out of his mind. ***"YOU CAN’T FIGHT THEM! YOU CAN’T! RUN! RUN! JUST RUN!"***  

Then, as if recalling something even worse, his eyes widen in terror. He turns to the young lawyer, his voice a desperate, broken scream. ***"NO! YOU CAN’T RUN! YOU CAN’T! THEY’RE FASTER! MUCH FASTER! THEY’LL CATCH YOU! THE SAME FATE! NO! NO! NOT AGAIN! NOT AGAIN!"***  

Hearing the commotion, three female officers burst into the room, two detectives and a lawyer. One turns sharply to the young lawyer who is trying to calm that old looking man, her voice sharp with accusation.  
***“How has sir fallen into this state again?”***

The young lawyer stammers, her face pale with guilt. ***"Mr. Z submitted his report and so I was checking it but sir suddenly come and snatch it from me and start checking. I have tried hard but I can't stop sir. After reading the reports, sir has fallen into that state again."***

The detective’s jaw tightens, her frustration boiling over. ***"How many times have I warned you all? No reports! No cases! Nothing that could trigger him!"***  

***"I’m sorry, ma’am! It won’t happen again!"*** the young lawyer whispers, her voice barely audible.  

Suddenly, a man rushes into the room, his face pale with urgency. ***"Madam! There’s an urgent case! We need to leave right now!"***  

At the sight of the newcomer, the old man’s gaze turns razor-sharp, filled with hatred and murderous intent. _**"RAPIST! MURDERER!"**_  he screams, lunging toward the man with a speed that defies his frail appearance.

The old man pounces again and again, landing blows with ferocious intensity, as if determined to tear the man apart limb by limb. Four female officers sprang into action, grappling with him to restrain his violent thrashing.

***"Run! Get out of here!"*** one of the detectives shouts at the man. ***"Do you want to end up hospitalized like Mr. X and Mr. Y?"***  

Another voice added urgently, _**"Get out! Get out of Sir's sight! In this state, he sees every man as a MONSTER!"**_

The man doesn't need to be told twice. His body moves before his mind catches up, legs trembling as he bolts out of the room.

But the old man isn’t done. His burning eyes stay locked on the retreating figure, his body still lunging forward despite the four officers restraining him.

The old looking man starts shouting as he can't move from their grip. ***"DON'T STOP ME! DON'T! LET ME GO! OTHERWISE..."*** 

His voice breaks.

Suddenly, the fire in his eyes flickers. His rage crumbles into something far worse. His expression shifts from hatred to terror, from fury to unbearable sorrow.

His body stiffens, his breathing ragged. His voice comes out barely above a whisper.

***"The same fate… The same fate… No… No… NOT AGAIN! NOT AGAIN!"***

And then, His vision blurs. In that hazy state, he catches glimpses of a few warm, bright smiles, gentle and comforting. For a fleeting moment, all his pain vanishes, replaced by an overwhelming sense of peace.

He tries to recall whose smiles they are. They feel so familiar, as if they belong to someone dear to him, someone he should never have forgotten.

But in the very next moment, his eyes widen in terror. A crushing sense of suffocation grips him as those warm, bright smiles twist into cold, silent screams echoing with unfathomable horror and despair.

His eyes and mouth wide open, frozen in guilt, sorrow, and agony. His body turns cold, and in that very state his **heart stops beating**.
