A few days later, the world outside is cloaked in the deep embrace of night, a silence so profound it feels almost tangible. Inside their small home, Fang Yuan sleeps peacefully in the comforting cradle of Fang Ma’s arms, his small body rising and falling in the gentle rhythm of slumber. Fang Fu rests soundly on the other side of their bed, a familiar presence in the quiet darkness. Suddenly, Fang Ma stirs awake. A strange sensation, not of pain but of an undeniable shift, draws her from the depths of sleep. The baby within her, the new life they have been eagerly awaiting, feels ready to enter the world. This time, however, there is no agonizing pain, no sharp discomfort like she experienced during Fang Yuan’s birth. This is the quiet, powerful reality of being a Rank 3 Gu Master. 

**The Gu Master cultivation system is divided into major ranks, from Rank 1 to Rank 9, with each major rank further subdivided into four minor stages: initial, middle, high, and peak.** **A Rank 3 Gu Master, like Fang Ma, possesses strength far beyond that of an ordinary human.** At the **initial stage of Rank 3**, a Gu Master’s power is equivalent to **250 times** that of a normal person. This increases to around **500 times** at the **middle stage**, then to approximately **750 times** at the **high stage**, and finally reaches an astonishing **1000 times** at the **peak stage of Rank 3**. The potential for growth is immense: a breakthrough to the **initial stage of Rank 4** would amplify their power to the range of **1000 to 2500 times** that of a human. This would further increase to around **5000 times** at **Rank 4 middle stage**, approximately **7500 times** at **Rank 4 high stage**, and an incredible **10,000 times** at the **peak stage of Rank 4**. The legendary **Rank 5 initial stage** then elevates their strength to a staggering range of **10,000 to 25,000 times** that of an ordinary person, culminating at the **peak stage of Rank 5** with a power level of an unbelievable **100,000 times** that of a normal human. For Fang Ma, being a Rank 3 Gu Master means this birthing is a natural, almost effortless process.

With graceful movements, she quietly slips out of bed, careful not to disturb Fang Yuan’s peaceful slumber. She then gently taps on Fang Fu’s hand, her touch light as a butterfly’s wing. Whispering softly into the stillness, she says, _“My dear husband, I think our new member is ready to arrive.”_ Fang Fu’s eyes flutter open, and he immediately understands the significance of her words. They both rise quietly, their movements synchronized by years of shared life, and leave the room, stepping into the hushed corridor. They enter another room, prepared for this very moment. Fang Ma sits on the bed, adjusting her position with a serene calmness, ready to welcome their new child. Fang Fu watches her, his brow furrowed with a familiar worry despite her calm demeanor. _“Are you feeling any pain or any discomfort, my love, like you did when Fang Yuan was born?”_ Fang Ma smiles reassuringly, her eyes filled with love and gentle strength. _“No, my darling! It feels… natural, peaceful.”_ Then, after a few serene moments, a soft cry fills the room. Fang Ma has given birth to a healthy baby boy.

A wave of relief and overwhelming joy washes over Fang Fu. He quickly calls for the waiting servants to come and clean up the birthing room, their hushed movements respectful of the sacred moment. Fang Ma, her face radiant with a mother’s love, begins to nurse her newborn son, Fang Zheng, offering him the life-giving milk. After some time, bathed and dressed in fresh clothes, with little Fang Zheng nestled securely in her arms, Fang Ma and Fang Fu make their way back to the main room where their firstborn son is still sleeping soundly. Gently, they approach Fang Yuan’s bedside and wake him up. His eyes flutter open, and he looks at his parents, a sleepy confusion on his face. Then, his gaze falls upon the tiny bundle in his mother’s arms. His eyes widen with excitement and curiosity. _“Mama, Papa! What is this?”_ Fang Ma smiles, her heart overflowing with love for both her sons. _“This is your little brother, my sweet boy. His name is Fang Zheng.”_ Fang Yuan’s face lights up with pure joy, a wide, innocent smile spreading across his features. He reaches out his small hands, eager to hold his new sibling. _“Fang Zheng!”_ he exclaims, his voice filled with delight, trying to take the baby into his arms with an enthusiastic grab that nearly sends Fang Zheng tumbling.

Fang Ma carefully adjusts her hold, lowering Fang Zheng closer to Fang Yuan, allowing him to gently pat his tiny brother’s head with a pudgy hand. Fang Yuan’s eyes are wide with wonder as he examines the small, sleeping face, his head tilting in curiosity. _“He’s so… small,”_ he whispers, his voice filled with awe. _“Can I hold him, Mama? Please? Please?”_ He reaches out again, his little arms outstretched with an earnest plea. Fang Ma smiles gently, her eyes twinkling with amusement. _“Soon, my little one. Fang Zheng is still very fragile, like a little flower. But you can sit here next to me, and you can look at him as much as you like.”_ She settles down on the bed, carefully positioning Fang Zheng beside her. Fang Yuan scoots closer, his gaze fixed intently on his new brother, his small body practically vibrating with excitement. He reaches out again, this time with exaggerated care, his tongue poking out in concentration as he attempts to lift Fang Zheng. He strains, his little arms trembling with the effort, but Fang Zheng remains firmly nestled against his mother.

_“He’s too heavy!”_ Fang Yuan exclaims, his face scrunched up in comical frustration as his attempt fails. He tries again, this time wrapping both arms around his brother’s middle, his grip more enthusiastic than effective. He tugs gently, then a little harder, his small body rocking back and forth with the effort, but Fang Zheng barely budges. Fang Ma and Fang Fu exchange amused glances, trying to suppress their laughter. Fang Yuan looks up at them, his eyes wide with a mixture of determination and bewilderment. _“Mama, help me! I want to hold my brother!”_ Fang Ma gently takes Fang Zheng into her arms again, preventing any accidental mishaps. _“I know you do, my sweet boy,”_ she says, her voice filled with affection. _“But you’re still a little too wobbly to hold him all by yourself. How about you sit right here next to me, and I’ll hold him, and you can put your arm around him?”_ Fang Yuan’s face brightens at this compromise. He carefully snuggles next to his mother, gently placing his arm around his tiny brother, a look of pure contentment spreading across his face. Fang Fu watches the heartwarming scene, a deep sense of love and happiness welling up within him. The room is filled with their soft laughter and loving gazes, a perfect picture of a family expanding and their bonds growing stronger with each passing moment.
