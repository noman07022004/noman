One week passes with deceptive speed, each day feeling like a fleeting moment. Now, Fang Yuan's patience has worn thin. He stands in the children's room, his small voice ringing with frustration as he addresses the servants who have been diligently caring for them. _"Why aren't Mother and Father coming back? I have a bad feeling about this. Take me to my father and mother."_

A kind-faced maid kneels before him, her expression gentle but firm. _"Young master, please be patient. Master and Mistress have gone for an important mission and will soon return."_

_"You have been saying the same thing for the last seven days!"_ Fang Yuan retorts, his lower lip trembling slightly. _"I don't care. Take me to my parents."_

Suddenly, a cheerful shout erupts from the corner of the room. Fang Zheng, his face alight with accomplishment, holds up a wobbly tower constructed from wooden blocks. _"Brother! Brother! Look! What we have built!"_ Fang Sianer, clapping her hands with delight, echoes his excitement, _"My love! My love!"_

Fang Yuan's attention shifts instantly. He rushes towards his younger siblings, his earlier frustration momentarily forgotten. _"Fang Zheng and my love,"_ he says, his voice softening with affection, _"you have really done well. How about we destroy it slowly, by taking off one block at a time?"_

Seeing their confusion, Fang Yuan gently demonstrates, carefully removing a block from the base of the tower. He then signals for them to take their turn, guiding their small hands with caution. For a brief moment, the room is filled with the innocent joy of children at play.

But this fragile happiness is abruptly shattered. The door bursts open, and a man stumbles into the room, tears streaming down his face, his body shaking with sobs. The maid who had been speaking with Fang Yuan turns to him, her brow furrowed with concern. _"What is the matter? Why are you crying?"_

The man can barely speak, his voice choked with grief as tears flow like a river down his cheeks. _"Master… and Mistress… they are no more."_

The maid's face drains of color, her eyes widening in disbelief and horror. A choked sob escapes her lips, and tears begin to well up in her own eyes.

A heavy silence descends upon the room as the other servants, drawn by the commotion, gather at the doorway. Sadness hangs in the air, thick and suffocating. Fang Ma and Fang Fu had always treated them with kindness and respect, offering help and support whenever they faced difficulties. A deep emotional bond had formed between the servants and the family.

Fang Yuan, his earlier frustration replaced by a growing sense of unease, asks worriedly, _"What has happened to my parents? Where are they? Why are you all crying?"_

The servants cannot bring themselves to meet his innocent gaze, their own eyes filled with tears and a terrible sorrow they don't know how to convey.

After a time that feels both fleeting and eternal, a loud, mournful noise drifts from the courtyard of their mansion. From within the room, they can hear the sound of a large gathering of people, their voices a low, sorrowful murmur.

A cold dread washes over Fang Yuan. His heart begins to pound faster and faster, an instinctual fear gripping his small chest. He looks at the servants, his eyes wide with a dawning understanding that something is terribly wrong. _"Look after Fang Zheng and Fang Sianer,"_ he commands, his voice trembling slightly but holding a surprising firmness. _"I am going to check what is going on outside."_

The servants' expressions speak volumes. They have already grasped the devastating truth from the messenger's words and the growing sounds of mourning outside. Tears now flow freely down their faces as they watch Fang Yuan move towards the door.

With a shared sense of protectiveness, they quickly scoop up Fang Zheng and Fang Sianer into their arms and rush outside, following closely behind Fang Yuan.

The scene in the courtyard is one of devastation. A large crowd has gathered, their faces etched with grief and shock. Some are visibly injured, their clothes torn and stained with blood. Others look deathly pale, as if they have narrowly escaped the clutches of death. A low murmur of questions and cries fills the air, _"What has happened?"_ _"How could this happen?"_

Fang Yuan's heart pounds in his chest, a primal fear taking root as his eyes fall upon two large, beautifully crafted coffins placed in the center of their spacious courtyard. His young mind doesn't yet comprehend the meaning of these ornate boxes, nor does he truly understand the concept of death. But even without explanation, tears begin to stream down his face, and his breath catches in his throat, becoming heavier and heavier with each passing moment.

He forces himself to move closer to the beautiful boxes, his small legs carrying him forward as if drawn by an invisible force. As he gets nearer, he hears snippets of hushed conversations drifting through the crowd. _"It is truly sad. This sudden incident was so unexpected."_ _"Those damn two Rank four Wolf Kings and those filthy Demonic cultivators!"_ _"Our situation would have been far worse if it weren't for Fang Fu."_ _"I can still recall the horrifying scene… Fang Fu became like a demon when he saw his wife being attacked by the wolves and those demonic cultivators at once."_ _"I can still recall how bloody the scene was… Fang Fu killed all those higher-rank wolves and demonic cultivators with a ferocity I have never witnessed."_ _"He was truly heroic… he took revenge for his wife."_

Suddenly, the crowd notices Fang Yuan approaching the coffins. A wave of sympathetic murmurs spreads through them. _"So sad… those poor children have lost their parents at such a young age."_

Finally, Fang Yuan stands before the coffins. His eyes widen, fixated on the polished wood. The tears that had been flowing freely now cease completely, as if frozen by the sheer magnitude of the moment. He feels a strange dryness in his throat, and his heart beats faster and louder, yet a suffocating pressure constricts his chest.

He looks into the open coffin on the left. His mother's beautiful face, usually so full of warmth and life, no longer appears beautiful. It is marred by scars and stained with dried blood. Her elegant features are contorted, bearing the horrifying marks of a brutal attack.

He then turns his gaze to the other coffin. His father's condition is even more gruesome. Many in the crowd avert their eyes, unable to bear the sight. His skull and face are broken, bearing the marks of countless savage attacks. His body is covered in blood, with glimpses of torn flesh and exposed internal organs visible. His face is so utterly broken that it is beyond recognition, yet one thing remains visible amidst the carnage: his eyes. Even in death, they still hold a fierce, unwavering determination.
