Just then, Fang Yuan’s eyes flutter open, and he whispers, his voice faint and dry, **"Mmm… W-water…"** Shen Cui reacts instantly, grabbing a nearby mug, filling it with water, and handing it to Fang Ma. **"Thank you, Shen Cui,"** Fang Ma says gratefully. She gently helps Fang Yuan sit up slightly so he can drink more easily.

But as Fang Yuan’s gaze falls upon Shen Cui and Fang Zheng, a flicker of a dark memory crosses his mind… he recalls the memories of him how he looks at Shen Cui with indifference, how he tormented her when she came to seduce him. This memory doesn't linger much, but as his eyes drift to Fang Zheng, a torrent of darker memories floods his mind instantly. He sees… the cold disregard, the subtle manipulations, the way he prioritized his own gain, even at his brother's expense. The weight of these recalled actions, coupled with the lingering shock of what he remembered doing to Yao Le, is too much. His eyes roll back, and he faints on the spot once more.

A day passes. The cycle of care continues. Fang Sianer tirelessly injects her martial essence, fueled by Fang Ma’s replenishing energy, with Yao Le offering support. Exhaustion is a constant companion. Then, as before, Fang Yuan stirs. **"Ma… ma… Water…"** Fang Ma, ever alert, jumps up from her rest. Yao Le swiftly provides the water. He drinks, and for a fleeting moment, a semblance of peace returns. But then, a strangled cry tears from his throat as the memories of his cold and calculating actions towards his own brother resurface, adding another layer of devastating guilt to the mental shock he is already enduring.

Time moves forward, the hours marked by their unwavering efforts. By afternoon, a fragile normalcy settles over the room. Fang Yuan, though still weak and struggling to articulate his thoughts, is sitting at a low table, playing a simple card game with Fang Ma, Fang Sianer, Yao Le, Fang Zheng, and Shen Cui. He seems to find a small measure of solace in the familiar routine.

At that moment, Fang Yuan’s aunt enters the room, her expression a mixture of concern and politeness. **"How is everything going, Sister Fang Ma?"** Fang Ma manages a weary but hopeful smile. **"It's going well. Fang Yuan’s condition is slowly improving."** Fang Yuan’s aunt says, **"My husband, Fang Yuan’s uncle, Dong Tu, wanted to check on him. He hasn’t had a proper chance to see Fang Yuan awake these past two months. He’s waiting outside."** Fang Ma rises from her casual seat beside Fang Yuan. **"Of course. Let him in. There’s no problem at all."** Fang Yuan’s aunt calls out, **"Husband, you can come in now."** Gu You Dong enters the room, and he and his wife approach Fang Yuan, who is still somewhat engrossed in the card game.

Seeing Fang Yuan awake, Dong Tu expresses his relief. **"Fang Yuan has finally woken up properly. It has been a long two months."** Fang Ma nods, a genuine smile touching her lips. **"It truly is a relief!"** Dong Tu then brings out a carefully wrapped martial potion and hands it to Fang Ma. **"This is a potent martial potion. It should help with Fang Yuan’s recovery."** Fang Ma accepts it gratefully. **"Thank you for your thoughtfulness, Brother."**

For a while, Fang Yuan remains oblivious to their arrival, his senses still struggling to fully integrate with his mind. But as his gaze eventually falls upon Dong Tu and his wife, his eyes suddenly widen, the playful scene around him dissolving into a horrifying vision. He is no longer in the familiar room but on a blood-soaked battlefield, his hands stained crimson as he cuts down his own clan members. His aunt and uncle are there, their faces contorted in terror, begging him for mercy, but he strikes them down without hesitation. The vision shatters, and Fang Yuan clutches his head, a strangled cry escaping his lips. He begins to grab and pull at his hair with a desperate, violent force, strands tearing free from his scalp. **"No… No… Why…? Why…? No… No… H-How… c-can… I…? H-How… c-can… I…?"** Each word is a monumental effort, ripped from a place of profound anguish.
