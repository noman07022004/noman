Years pass quickly, a blur of happiness, a stolen paradise. They have two daughters, one ten, one seven, their laughter filling their home, their presence a constant source of joy. He is utterly, completely happy with his wife and daughters. They are his world, the center of his universe, the reason for his every breath. His wife has healed, the horrifying memories finally fading into the background, replaced by the warmth of their shared life. He dedicates himself to being the kindest, gentlest, most loving husband and father he can possibly be, pouring all his love into them.

He spends most of his time with his daughters, their days filled with laughter and games. He allows them to practice their makeup skills on him, their small hands smearing bright colors on his face. Sometimes, they apply so much makeup that even his wife is amazed, laughing at his painted face, her heart overflowing with love for her playful husband and their happy children. What astonishes her even more is the depth of love between him and their daughters. They adore their father, preferring to play with him, making her playfully jealous, a sweet ache in her heart. He, as a good father, gives them all his attention, sometimes making her feign annoyance at being overlooked.

Initially, she had reservations about him, a dignified and respected lawyer, allowing their daughters to put makeup on him and even cut his hair. She feared he was losing his dignity, that if anyone saw him, his reputation would be ruined, that the world would judge him. But he made it clear that their daughters' happiness, their innocent joy, mattered more than any societal standard, any reputation. He told her that even if they made him look like a joker or a weirdo before the whole world, he didn't mind. It only proved that he was the happiest man alive, that his joy came from his family, not from the world's approval. From then on, she shed her reservations, embracing her own playful, even childish, side, joining in their games, their laughter a symphony of happiness.

Their life is a fairy tale, a stolen moment of perfect joy, filled only with happiness and love. But this joy, this fairy tale, cannot last forever. The darkness they had escaped, the evil he had fought, had not forgotten them. It had been waiting, patient and vengeful.

One day, he returns home at his usual time, his heart light, anticipating the welcoming chaos of his daughters and the warm smile of his wife. But the house is silent. Eerily silent. His wife and daughters are not there. He calls for them, his voice filled with a growing unease, a cold dread beginning to creep into his heart, but there is no answer. The silence is deafening. Days turn into weeks, then months, each one a torment. There is no news, no ransom demand, just silence. The police investigation, slow and agonizing, reveals a horrifying truth: his wife and daughters have been kidnapped. The kidnappers are identified – the gang members he had sent to prison years ago, the ones who had attempted to rape his wife and whom he had shot. They hadn't died from his bullets but were imprisoned, their hatred festering over the years, growing into a monstrous thirst for revenge. Investigations reveal they had been meticulously planning this, tracking his family, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, for over a year. Their plan is flawless, executed with chilling precision; even the full force of the police and army, mobilized to find them, fail to track them down. **They are gone.**

After a few agonizing days, days that stretch into an eternity of fear and helplessness, a live stream goes viral on the internet, a horrifying spectacle of pure evil, a window into hell. Around thirty men, their faces twisted with malice and a chilling sense of triumphant revenge, are violently raping his wife and daughters. **The live stream captures their screams, raw with terror, their desperate resistance, their pleas for mercy, the sheer helplessness and terror on their faces, a scene of unimaginable brutality that tears at the fabric of reality.** The violation is relentless, repeated for hours without pause, a continuous cycle of torment, a living nightmare broadcast to the world.

In the live stream, they look directly into the camera, into his soul, and mock him, their faces cruel and triumphant. ***"You righteous lawyer! You dared to send us to jail, something no one else had the guts to do! This is the consequence of your righteousness! This is what happens when you cross us! Ha ha ha!"***

He watches, his world collapsing into a black abyss, his mind shattering into a million pieces. He desperately begs them in the comment section to stop, his words a torrent of agony, offering them anything, his life, his wealth, anything they want, just to make them stop, to make the horror end. But they ignore his pleas, reveling in his torment, in his helplessness. Instead, they turn the camera to his daughters, forcing them to speak to their father, to witness his powerlessness. ***"Father,"*** his daughters cry out, their voices broken, their eyes wide with a desperate plea that will forever haunt him, a sound that will echo in his mind for the rest of his existence, ***"please save us. Please save us. It hurts, Father, it hurts so much!"***

And then, in an act of unimaginable cruelty, they turn to the audience, asking for suggestions on what to do next, on how to make this a truly unforgettable "history," a spectacle of suffering for the world to witness. The comments, a chilling reflection of the darkness in some hearts, suggest further acts of unimaginable brutality, their words fueling the torment, adding to the horror.

The brutal rape and torture continue for hours, each moment an eternity of agony for him as he is forced to watch, helpless, powerless to intervene. Finally, his daughters succumb, their young lives extinguished by the relentless violence. **Their screams fall silent, but the echoes live on in his soul.** Even after their death, the men continue to violate their lifeless bodies, their depravity knowing no bounds, their actions a final, sickening desecration.

His wife’s condition is critical, her body broken, her spirit shattered, on the very verge of death. Suddenly, one of the men turns the camera to her, a cruel smile on his face. ***"Why don't you say some last words to your husband!"*** he sneers. ***"He must be enjoying watching you suffer!"***

She looks weakly at the camera, her eyes clouded with pain, with a love that transcends the horror, her voice barely a whisper, a final act of selfless devotion, a message meant only for him. ***"My husband… don't blame yourself. Forget about us… pretend we never existed. Find happiness again. Live your life. If there is an afterlife… we will be waiting for you there."*** Her eyes close, her last breath escaping her lips, her spirit finally free from the torment, from the living hell she was forced to endure. **She is gone.**

Fang Yuan has already gone mad. Witnessing the live stream, the death of his family, the unspeakable brutality – it is too much for any human to bear. He has tried multiple times to end his own life, the pain of living with the horror a constant, agonizing torment. **He wants only oblivion.**

Months pass quickly, a blur of pain and despair, but Fang Yuan’s condition only worsens. He descends into complete, irreversible madness, the trauma consuming him entirely. Then, another horrifying event unfolds, a final, cruel twist of fate designed to break him completely. He receives three parcels in the mail, delivered to him at the hospital where he is confined, his mind lost in the labyrinth of his pain. He opens them to find three severed heads – the heads of his wife and daughters. **Their eyes are empty, their faces frozen in a final, silent scream.** Weeks later, three headless bodies are found in a dustbin, identified as his wife and daughters. **The final, brutal confirmation.**

The news of their death, the brutality of it, is kept from him by the doctors, the police, the army. They try everything in their power to shield him from the full horror, from the gruesome details, from the truth that would shatter him completely. For years, through advanced therapy, through countless hours of dedicated effort, they manage to pull him back from the brink of complete insanity, to a semblance of normalcy. He becomes somewhat functional, mostly normal, but the slightest thought of his wife or daughters, the briefest flicker of a memory, sends him spiraling back into madness, the trauma resurfacing with brutal force.

Full-time actors are hired to play the roles of his wife and daughters, a desperate, heartbreaking attempt to create a reality where they are still alive, hoping this will aid his recovery, to give him a fragile anchor to the world, a world that has shown him only cruelty. His condition improves, a fragile peace settles upon him. But one day, accidentally, he stumbles upon the news, the true, unvarnished horror of what happened to his wife and daughters – the live stream, the heads, the bodies. The government, the doctors, everyone tried to hide it, to bury the truth, but the truth finds him, a relentless predator.

He collapses, his body unable to bear the weight of the renewed trauma, suffering multiple heart attacks. When he recovers, something is fundamentally broken within him, something that can never be repaired. Not a single tear falls from his eyes, the wellspring of sorrow has long since dried up, leaving behind an arid wasteland of pain. But the wide, tearless, empty gaze speaks volumes of a pain that transcends tears, a suffering so profound it has burned away the very ability to weep. He is a living corpse, his spirit extinguished, leaving behind only a shell of a man, haunted by the ghosts of his past.
