The next day dawns with a fragile sense of progress. Fang Yuan’s physical state is noticeably improved compared to the previous night, though the shadow of his mental anguish still lingers. He has woken, and Fang Ma, with a gentle and unwavering care, has cleaned him and made him comfortable.

**"Yao Le, Sianer,"** Fang Ma says, her voice softer than usual, yet carrying a quiet strength, **"look after Fang Yuan for a while. I am going to prepare his favorite dishes with my own hands. After he has eaten, you two can go to the academy."**

Fang Sianer’s head snaps up, her eyes wide with protest. **"No, Mama! I am not going today! Brother has finally woken up after more than a month! I am staying here with him. And he still can't even speak properly!"**

Yao Le echoes her friend’s defiance, her voice equally firm. **"Yes, Aunty! Sister Sianer is right! We are not going to the academy today."**

Fang Ma’s own exhaustion is evident, the toll of her constant care for Fang Yuan etched on her face. She has personally attended to his every need, from the most basic to the most comforting, allowing no servant to intervene. If she had more time and strength, she would have cooked every meal herself. In her heart, she has steeled herself for a long and arduous journey to bring her son fully back to them. She has even confronted the terrifying possibility of the future Fang Yuan attempting to take over, but her love, she believes, is a powerful force, capable of changing even a predetermined fate that is designed by the evil author for fang yuan to make him that evil and cruel. She will fight with every fiber of her being, accepting even failure and the ultimate sacrifice if it means her son has a chance. And as a mother, she strives to maintain a semblance of normalcy for her other children, hence her usual insistence on Fang Zheng and Fang Sianer attending the academy. But today, she relents. **"Alright,"** she says, her gaze softening as she looks at their determined faces. **"You don't have to go to the academy today. But tomorrow, you both must go."**

As Fang Ma leaves to prepare the special meal, a quiet activity fills the room. Fang Sianer, Yao Le, and Fang Yuan are sitting together, surrounded by a collection of colorful, magnetic building blocks of various shapes and sizes – cubes, circles, squares, triangles, some shiny, others with matte finishes. They click together easily, drawn by magnetic force, and a special demagnetization tool rests nearby, along with a device to amplify their magnetic connection. They are constructing their mansion, a miniature replica that is nearing completion. **"Look, Brother!"** Fang Sianer exclaims, her voice filled with a childlike excitement, **"It's almost finished! It really looks like our home!"** Fang Yuan’s response is slow, his voice still fractured and weak. **"Y-yes… it’s… be-beautiful…"** The effort of speaking seems immense, each word a hesitant step.

Soon after, Fang Ma returns, followed by servants carrying trays laden with food. They arrange it on a table within Fang Yuan’s room. **"Sianer, Yao Le,"** Fang Ma says gently, **"you two can eat in a little while. Continue playing with Fang Yuan while I feed him first."** She begins to spoon a fragrant soup she has prepared, her gaze tender as she feeds her son, watching him interact with Fang Sianer and Yao Le.

After everyone has finished their breakfast, Fang Yuan lies back on the bed, a peaceful exhaustion settling over him. Fang Sianer and Yao Le have been persuaded to go to their rooms to rest, the early morning and their tireless care having taken their toll. At that moment, Fang Zheng and Shen Cui enter the room, their expressions concerned. **"Brother's condition looks much better than last night,"** Fang Zheng observes, a hint of relief in his voice. Shen Cui nods in agreement. **"It was really worrying. It's good to see him improving."**

**"Yes,"** Fang Ma replies, her gaze soft as she looks at Fang Yuan. **"It's good of you both to come and check on him. Are you ready to go to the academy?"** Fang Zheng nods. **"Yes, we were just leaving. Won't Sianer and Yao Le be going today?"** Fang Ma explains, **"They wanted to stay with Fang Yuan since he just woke up."**

Just then, Fang Yuan’s eyes flutter open, and he whispers, his voice faint and dry, **"Mmm… W-water…"** Shen Cui reacts instantly, grabbing a nearby mug, filling it with water, and handing it to Fang Ma. **"Thank you, Shen Cui,"** Fang Ma says gratefully. She gently helps Fang Yuan sit up slightly so he can drink more easily. But as Fang Yuan’s gaze falls upon Shen Cui, a flicker of a dark memory crosses his mind… the coldness… the indifference… _his_ coldness towards Shen Cui…
