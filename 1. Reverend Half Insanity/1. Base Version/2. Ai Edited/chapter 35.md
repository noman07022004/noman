The silence hangs heavy in the cave, punctuated only by Fang Yuan's ragged breathing and the soft lapping of the revitalized river against the shore. The youths and elders watch, their faces a mixture of shock and confusion, grappling with the unprecedented events.

Suddenly, all the Hope Martial Parasites that pulse with light in the River of Flowers, the glowing fish, the shimmering bugs, the radiant flowers, the luminous rocks, and even the water itself – they begin to glow with an astonishing, blinding brilliance. The light intensifies, reaching a peak of radiant energy, and then, in perfect synchronicity, Fang Ma and Fang Sianer both gasp, their eyes widening in shock. A warmth, a profound, peaceful sensation blossoms within their hearts. **Something is forming within them.** For that moment, both Fang Ma and Fang Sianer become so utterly shocked by this unexpected internal sensation that they forget about their tears, forget about their fear for Fang Yuan. Without consciously willing it, they both instinctively try to feel it, to understand this new sensation, and then they feel it clearly. **They both have awakened their martial core.**

A martial core is the very source of power for any martial master. It forms within someone's heart, a secondary organ pulsating with potential. From this core, martial essence, a substance as vital and fluid as blood, is channeled throughout their body, allowing them to use martial tools or parasites, to tap into the very energies of the world. You can call it a second heart, but unlike the heart that constantly beats and channels blood to sustain life, the martial core acts as a storage, holding martial essence that can be called upon instantly with just a thought. When a martial core is destroyed, a person theoretically loses all their power, becoming like a normal mortal. Though, in reality, their bodies retain some residual strength, they are often treated as powerless by those who still wield martial might. As a martial core forms, a person feels a deep warmth, a sense of peace, and a profound, almost spiritual connection with this new source of power. That is why both Fang Ma and Fang Sianer react with such stunned awe and inner peace.

But before they can fully explore this miraculous, unexpected awakening, before they can fully understand the power now contained within their hearts, they feel something else, something terrifyingly wrong. All the hope martial parasites, moments before radiating blinding light, are rushing towards Fang Yuan with astonishing speed, drawn by an invisible, powerful force. Their light and glow are extinguishing with horrifying rapidity as they approach him, like stars winking out of existence. Within a few breaths, the full River of Flowers, which had been glowing with such vibrant, dim light, loses its radiance completely. It's as if Fang Yuan is a black hole, sucking the light, the hope, right out of them, and that light is transforming, becoming dark, a palpable blackness, before circling around him, drawn into his very being.

This is not just abnormal; it is a terrifying violation of nature itself. Dark means the absence of light. So darkness is merely the absence of light. But everyone around can _see_ this dark light. The dark light is also emitting light but the light is shadow. The dark light is emitting shadow as it's light.

After a few horrifying moments, all this dark light, this visible embodiment of despair, enters into Fang Yuan's body. A wave of profound, chilling cold washes over him. He feels that something has formed within his heart, in the place where a martial core should be. With a will forged in a past life of relentless pursuit, Fang Yuan tries to feel what it is, concentrating all his consciousness, all his focus, investigating this new, terrifying presence within him.

Suddenly, from the deepest, darkest corner of his mind, Fang Yuan hears the terrifying voice again. It is not a whisper; it is a sound that resonates in the very core of his being, shaking his soul, his essence. _**"Look at your pathetic condition. You had succeeded and made your younger self accept you and then the merging process of you and your younger self also started. But for those two…"**_ The voice is filled with a chilling indifference, a cold contempt that freezes his blood. _**"...you have failed. Your younger self now again rejecting you.  It is not like you haven't gained anything. You have gained slight control over your younger self's mind, but this is almost non-existent. And the most unexpected thing is that your younger self… has awakened the demonic martial core which no-one has ever awakened."**_

Forget about checking his martial core, forget about the River of Flowers, forget about the onlookers. Fang Yuan’s entire being is consumed by a terror so profound, so absolute, that every fiber of his being trembles violently. His eyes and mouth are wide open, frozen in a silent scream. Terrorizing fear is written all over his face, a mask of pure horror.

Sensing the sudden, violent shift in Fang Yuan, seeing the raw terror erupting on his face, Fang Ma’s heart stops beating for a moment, a jolt of fear piercing through her newfound power. She suddenly recalls the terrifying condition of Fang Yuan last night, the shaking, the sweat, the unspoken horror. Fang Sianer cries out, a small, heartbreaking sound, as she senses the sudden, overwhelming fear radiating from Fang Yuan, who is still in her embrace, his body now trembling more violently than ever.

The cave, moments before filled with the radiant glow of hope, is now plunged into a suffocating darkness. The primary source of light was the River of Flowers, which is no longer glowing, as if the whole river, the very essence of hope it represented, has died, consumed by the darkness. Only the glowing stones embedded in the walls emit a dim, struggling light, providing a faint, ghostly illumination.

After a few moments, the clan elders, snapped out of their trance by the unsettling darkness and Fang Yuan's obvious terror, exchange bewildered glances. Their initial awe has been replaced by alarm. They rush towards Fang Yuan, their movements urgent. An elder, his face grim, quickly brings out a martial lamp, a tool used to provide light in dark places, and begins to channel his martial essence into it. The lamp starts glowing, dimly at first, then brighter and brighter as he injects more power. Within a few breaths, the whole cave lights up, pushing back the oppressive darkness, revealing the horrifying scene – Fang Yuan, kneeling in the center of the now-blackened riverbed, trembling, his face a mask of terror, while the elders rush towards him to check what is actually going on, fear and confusion etched on their faces.
