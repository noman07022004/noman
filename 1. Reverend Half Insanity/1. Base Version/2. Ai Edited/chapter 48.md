Another week passes by quickly. During this time, Fang Sianer has continuously injected her primeval essence into Fang Yuan's martial core. And Fang Ma and Yao Le helped Fang Sianer to replenish her martial essence. They continued this process after taking some rest, and it was non-stop. They didn't miss a single day.

Now Fang Yuan's face looks peaceful and calm. And he looks even more healthy. And Yao Le looks most exhausted, and then Fang Ma. But surprisingly, Fang Sianer's condition is pretty good; only a small exhaustion can be seen.

Right now, they are all working hard. Fang Sianer is injecting her martial essence into Fang Yuan's martial core, while Fang Ma is injecting her martial essence into Fang Sianer's martial core to replenish her martial essence. And Yao Le is taking rest, lying beside Fang Yuan while looking at Fang Yuan's peaceful face with a loving and fragile hope.

Then, it happens. Fang Yuan’s eyelids flutter, a delicate movement that sends a jolt of anticipation through the room. Slowly, hesitantly, his eyes begin to open, his vision, unused for so long, gradually becoming clearer.

Yao Le’s breath catches in her throat. Her eyes widen, disbelief warring with elation. "Brother Fang Yuan!" she cries out, the shout a joyous, unrestrained release of weeks of pent-up worry. She sits up abruptly, her hand flying to her mouth.

The sudden, loud sound pierces Fang Yuan’s returning consciousness. He turns his head towards Yao Le, his vision still blurry. He blinks, confusion clouding his features. He feels… strong. Strangely rested. He lifts a hand, rubbing his eyes like someone just waking from a deep sleep, pushing himself up to sit.

Before he can fully orient himself, Yao Le surges forward, launching herself at him. Her emotions, a potent cocktail of fear, relief, and the lingering memory of his protective embrace before her own collapse, overwhelm her. She throws her arms around him, tears already welling in her eyes.

Fang Ma’s eyes snap open at Yao Le’s cry. She had been a statue of weary hope, but now, a radiant joy floods her face, banishing the exhaustion. Tears stream down her cheeks. "Oh, my son! My love! You have finally woken up!" she cries, reaching out, her hands trembling. She quickly embraces him, her hug tight and filled with a fierce, protective love.

Fang Sianer’s eyes flutter open as she feels Fang Yuan’s subtle movement, the shift as he pulls his hand away to rub his eyes. Her concentration breaks, and she looks at him, truly seeing him awake for the first time in what feels like an eternity. A choked sob escapes her lips. "My love!" she whispers, her own tears flowing freely as she reaches out and embraces him, joining the emotional outpouring.

Fang Yuan, surrounded by their fervent embrace, their tears, their overwhelming joy, is utterly confused. He feels… different. Stronger, yes, but also… a strange disconnect. For him, it truly feels as if he has just opened his eyes after a long, dreamless sleep. "Is there… is there something wrong?" he asks, his voice raspy, his brow furrowed in bewilderment.

A chorus of relieved denials washes over him. "No! We are just happy!" they reply in unison, their voices thick with emotion.

Then, Fang Yuan’s gaze focuses clearly on Yao Le’s face. As he truly sees her, the pieces of the fragmented memories from the River of Flowers, the horrifying glimpses of his future self, begin to coalesce. The brutal image of Yao Le’s sacrifice, the cold calculation in his past self’s eyes as he turned her into a martial elixir, crashes into his consciousness with brutal force.

His eyes widen in dawning horror. The peace that had settled on his face shatters. Tears well up again, but these are not tears of confusion; they are tears of terror and a profound, visceral guilt. He feels a suffocating pressure in his chest, his body starting to tremble violently once more.

Seeing this sudden, terrifying change, the joy in Fang Ma, Fang Sianer, and Yao Le’s hearts freezes. Their smiles vanish, replaced by a chilling fear. Their hearts pound in their chests, the joy turning to a sickening dread of losing him again. This time, Fang Yuan doesn't faint. He remains conscious, his eyes wide with a dawning, horrifying self-awareness. His mouth opens and closes several times, a silent struggle as he tries to speak, but the words remain trapped in his throat.

They are still embracing him, their arms a protective circle, but Fang Yuan’s gaze is fixed solely on Yao Le. He tries again and again to utter words, his lips trembling. He tries to extend a hand towards her, a gesture of… what? Apology? Regret? But his hand trembles so violently he cannot control it. And a deeper, more terrifying realization dawns within him. He is fearful. Fearful of his own hands, the hands that committed that atrocity in the memory. Fearful of his own mouth, the mouth that uttered those cold, calculating words. Fearful of his own being, the vessel that held such darkness.

Why does it feel so different this time? Because before, the memories felt like an external force, something being shoved into his mind. But now… now it feels like a recollection, a surfacing of something that was always there, a hidden truth about who he truly is.

Time stretches, each silent, trembling moment amplifying the horror. Fang Yuan’s condition doesn’t improve; it worsens as the full weight of his remembered future self crashes down upon him. He is terrified. Terrified of the monster he was, the monster that might still lurk within him.

Because in his previous life on Earth, he fought against monsters, against the darkness of the world. He went mad with the realization that that darkness might be endless, unstoppable, yet even in his madness, he continued to fight, to protect the innocent, until his bitter end.

And in this life, he is known as the Messenger of Love. The one who helps everyone, who brings smiles and hope. He is surrounded by love.

But now, recalling the future his past self carried back, he is confronted with a horrifying truth. He is the darkness he fought against. He is the one who snatches smiles, who inflicts terror and hopelessness. The Messenger of Love… and the monstrous killer. The two halves of himself collide, a brutal, terrifying paradox that threatens to shatter his sanity. His gaze remains locked on Yao Le, a silent scream trapped within him, a desperate plea for forgiveness that he doesn't know if he deserves.
