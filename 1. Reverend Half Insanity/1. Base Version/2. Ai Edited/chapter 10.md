Days have flown by with surprising speed. Each one a precious memory woven into the fabric of their family life. Six months have passed since Fang Zheng’s arrival. He is now a healthy, thriving infant. His growth progresses at a steady pace.

Fang Yuan, true to his protective nature, is constantly by his younger brother’s side. He diligently attempts to teach him new things. He showers him with affection. He always tries to elicit a giggle from the baby.

At this very moment, Fang Yuan is engrossed in a game with Fang Zheng. They are using a collection of small, intricately carved wooden animals. Their laughter, a delightful melody, fills the air as they play.

Nearby, Fang Ma and Fang Fu are leaning comfortably against the headboard of their bed. Fang Ma is nestled affectionately against Fang Fu’s side. Their eyes are filled with warmth and contentment. They watch their two sons. It is a silent testament to the happiness that now permeates their home.

Notably, while Fang Yuan no longer displays the fierce jealousy he once did when his parents showed affection, he still maintains his decree. His father is not allowed to kiss his mother, though gentle touches are now tolerated.

Suddenly, breaking the comfortable silence, Fang Ma sighs contentedly. _“It truly is a miracle, isn’t it, my love? Our family continues to grow, bringing us such immense joy.”_

Fang Fu gently responds while placing his hands gently on Fang Ma's belly. A tender smile graces his lips. _“Oh, my dear, you are the miracle that started it all. Look at your belly, a new life is blossoming within you soon.”_

Suddenly Fang Yuan looks at them. His playful expression shifts to one of hopeful anticipation. _“Mother, Father!”_ he shouts. His voice is filled with childlike enthusiasm. _“I want to get a sister! I want a little sister!”_

Fang Ma smiles at his innocent declaration. Her voice is gentle and loving as she replies. _“My dear Fang Yuan! I also hope with all my heart that it is a girl who will join our family.”_

She pauses for a moment. Her gaze softens as she looks at her firstborn. _“But my sweet Fang Yuan, it wouldn’t be so bad if you got another brother, would it?”_

In a flash, Fang Yuan’s playful energy shifts. He jumps off the floor and onto the bed next to Fang Ma. His small face is determined.

Then, with surprising strength for his age, he grabs both of Fang Fu's hands. He pulls them away from his mother’s belly with a decisive tug. He throws them playfully to the side.

Seeing this familiar display of possessiveness, Fang Fu and Fang Ma exchange a gentle, knowing laugh.

Fang Yuan then carefully lifts his mother’s tunic. It reveals the gentle curve of her pregnant belly. His brow furrows in concentration. He starts rubbing it gently with his small hand. His ear is pressed close as if trying to decipher the secrets held within.

He waits, listening intently for any sign of the new life growing there. Observing Fang Yuan’s earnest actions, Fang Fu and Fang Ma exchange a loving, amused gaze.

Suddenly, Fang Yuan pulls back. His eyes are wide and filled with conviction. _“It would be a girl. It would be my sister.”_

Hearing this confident pronouncement from their little one, Fang Fu throws his head back and laughs heartily. His eyes are twinkling with amusement and affection. _“Well, if our little tyrant has declared it with such unwavering certainty, then it is as good as confirmed! We are getting a girl, what do you say, my dear wife?”_

Fang Ma looks at Fang Yuan. Her eyes are filled with a loving gaze and a playful smile that mirrors her husband’s. _“Yes, my love. As my little tyrant has declared with such absolute conviction, it must indeed be a girl who will join our family next.”_

Fang Yuan adds, _“Mother, your belly is really big! It means my sister is coming out soon. Previously, I haven't seen how I and Fang Zheng has come out of your belly, So, I will see how she is going to come out from her. Ok.”_

Hearing this declaration, Fang Ma and Fang Fu exchange awkward gazes.

Fang Ma pulls Fang Yuan close, embracing him gently and showering him with gentle kisses. _“Ok, my dear,”_ she says softly, _“you will see how your sister comes out of your mother.”_

Days drift into the past with silent speed, and another dark night has enveloped their home. Fang Fu and Fang Ma are asleep at opposite edges of their bed, while Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng lie nestled in the middle, a small barrier of warmth and innocence between them. Suddenly, Fang Ma’s eyes flutter open. Just as before, a gentle nudge awakens Fang Fu with a whispered word. They rise with practiced quietness and make their way to the familiar birthing room. Fang Ma settles onto the bed, preparing herself once more.

_“My dear,”_ Fang Fu whispers, his voice laced with concern, _“are you feeling any discomfort?”_

Fang Ma smiles serenely. _“No, my love,”_ she replies softly, _“rather, I am feeling very comfortable, as if she is a gentle light in the vast darkness.”_

Fang Fu gives a gentle smile, a hint of wonder in his eyes. _“Fang Yuan was born after only three months, and Fang Zheng arrived after nine. Now, our new little one is coming at fifteen months. It's truly amazing! They are like triplets, yet not born at the same time. It's an unbelievable situation. One born ahead of time, another right on schedule, and now our new one is arriving fashionably late. It's incredible how our little family is growing so big in such a short period.”_

Before Fang Ma can respond, a soft cry fills the room. They both gasp, turning their attention to the newest member of their family. With gentle hands, they check and find that it is indeed a girl. A shared look of astonishment passes between them as they take in her tiny size. Fang Yuan had been unusually large for a newborn, almost monstrous in comparison. Fang Zheng’s size was perfectly normal. But little Fang Sianer is the smallest of them all, though she appears perfectly healthy and remarkably lively, her small limbs moving with surprising energy.

Fang Ma quickly takes her into her arms, her voice filled with a mother’s tender adoration. _“Oh, my daughter, Fang Sianer,”_ she whispers, kissing her tiny forehead, _“you look absolutely heavenly.”_ She then gently guides Fang Sianer to her breast, and the baby begins to nurse contentedly.

Just as before, Fang Fu quietly calls for the waiting maids, and they swiftly and silently clean up the room. Once everything is tidied, Fang Fu and Fang Ma carefully make their way back towards the main room, where Fang Yuan is sleeping soundly with his arm gently placed over his younger brother, Fang Zheng. Fang Ma softly lights up the room with a gentle wave of her hand, casting a warm glow. _“My dear,”_ she says softly, nudging Fang Yuan gently, _“look, you have got a little sister, just as you wanted.”_

Hearing his mother’s voice, Fang Yuan’s eyes snap open. His sleepiness vanishes instantly as he sees the tiny infant nestled in Fang Ma’s arms. _“What is her name?”_ he asks, his voice filled with awe and wonder.

_“It is Fang Sianer,”_ Fang Fu responds from beside them, a proud smile on his face.

Fang Yuan’s face erupts into a wide, joyful grin. He sits up quickly, his small hands clapping together. _“Fang Sianer, Fang Sianer! I really got a little sister!”_ Fang Ma sits down on the bed beside him, holding Fang Sianer carefully. _“Would you like to hold her, my dear?”_ she asks gently.

_“Yes, Mama, I want to!”_ Fang Yuan declares excitedly, reaching out his arms. Fang Ma carefully places Fang Sianer into Fang Yuan’s eager embrace. A look of astonishment washes over Fang Yuan’s face as he realizes he can easily hold her, despite being only one year old. He cradles her gently, his eyes wide with wonder. He starts playing with Fang Sianer, making different kinds of funny faces and soft noises, trying to make her laugh.

Hearing all the excited shouts, Fang Zheng stirs in his sleep and then wakes up, letting out a loud cry. Fang Fu quickly scoops Fang Zheng into his arms, gently rocking him and whispering soothing words to calm him down. Just then, as if sensing the commotion, Fang Sianer also starts to cry. Fang Ma quickly takes her back and begins to breastfeed her, and she soon quiets down, contentedly nursing.

But at this moment, Fang Yuan’s earlier excitement is replaced by a look of indignation. _“Father, Mother!”_ he shouts, his voice tinged with accusation. _“Why didn't you call me before Fang Sianer was born?”_

Fang Fu, who is still gently rocking a now calmer Fang Zheng in his arms, and Fang Ma, who is feeding the peacefully nursing Fang Sianer, exchange another awkward glance. _“My dear,”_ Fang Fu begins hesitantly, _“you were sleeping so soundly…”_

Fang Yuan interrupts, his brow furrowed in genuine confusion. _“But… but how did she come out? I’ve been watching Mama’s belly, and I haven’t seen any way for her to come out!”_ He looks from his mother’s belly to the tiny baby in her arms, his mind clearly struggling to comprehend the logistics of the situation. _“Fang Zheng just appeared one day, and now Fang Sianer too! how have they come out of your belly?”_ Then pointing out at Fang Ma's belly, he shouts with confusion, _“Look there is no way out? How have she managed to come out of your belly?”_

Fang Ma smiles again, a mischievous glint in her eyes. _“Alright, my curious little detective,”_ she says. _“Here's another secret, just between us. You see, Mama has a very special... magical zipper!”_

Fang Yuan’s head tilts in confusion. _“A zipper? Like on my clothes?”_

Fang Fu nods seriously. _“Exactly like that, but magical and invisible most of the time. It's right here on Mama's tummy.”_ He gently touches Fang Ma's belly. _“When a baby is ready to be born, this magical zipper quietly unzips all by itself.”_

_“And then,”_ Fang Ma continues, winking at Fang Yuan, _“our little baby opens the magical zipper from inside, and then mama carefully picks it out as you picks a toys out of a bag! Once the baby is out and safe in our arms, the zipper magically zips back up, and no one can even tell it was there.”_

Fang Yuan’s eyes widen in surprise. He leans closer to his mother’s belly, peering intently, as if trying to find the invisible zipper. He runs his small hand over her stomach, searching for any sign of it.

_“But I can't see it,”_ he says, his voice full of wonder. _“Where is it?”_

_“That's the magic part!”_ Fang Fu exclaims with a playful smile. _“It only appears when it's time for a baby to come out. It's a super-secret, a magical baby-exit zipper!”_

Fang Yuan looks from his mother’s smooth belly to the tiny Fang Zheng, then to the even tinier Fang Sianer. He tries to imagine a zipper opening and closing, letting them out into the world. A look of utter astonishment washes over his face.

_“So… I along with Fang Zheng and Fang Sianer… just… unzipped Mama’s tummy and then you pick up just as I pick up toys from a bag?”_ He asks, his voice filled with awe and a touch of disbelief. He stares at his mother’s belly with a newfound respect, imagining the secret, magical zipper hidden beneath her belly.
