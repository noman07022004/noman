The night passes in a fragile stillness. Fang Yuan sleeps, but the remnants of terror linger in the tightness around his eyes, the faint tremor that occasionally ripples through his small frame. Fang Ma watches him, her face etched with worry and exhaustion, a mirror of the weariness reflected in Fang Sianer and Yao Le’s expressions as they too finally succumb to sleep, Sianer leaning against her brother, Fang Ma slumped in a nearby chair. Only Yao Le remains awake for a long while, her young face troubled as she gazes at Fang Yuan.

The next afternoon brings a semblance of normalcy. Fang Yuan sits at a low table, surrounded by Fang Sianer, Yao Le, Fang Zheng, and Shen Cui, a collection of drawing materials spread before them. Fang Zheng and Shen Cui are somewhat apart, a comfortable bubble forming around their quiet interactions, their budding affection an open secret that Fang Ma observes with a gentle smile. Yao Le and Fang Sianer are closer to Fang Yuan, their focus on the drawings, while Fang Ma oversees them all, offering occasional guidance.

Fang Yuan’s hand trembles as he tries to sketch. The precise movements required for drawing are still beyond him, unlike the simpler manipulations of the card and building games. Yet, he persists, attempting to capture his mother's likeness. The lines are shaky, uncertain. Fang Ma gently guides his hand, helping him create simple outlines. Slowly, a recognizable figure emerges – Fang Ma, smiling. Beside her, on one side of the page, Fang Yuan adds quick sketches of Fang Sianer and Yao Le, their figures close together. On the other side, smaller and slightly separate, are the recognizable outlines of Fang Zheng and Shen Cui. It’s a simple, almost childlike drawing, yet each person is identifiable, a snapshot of their small, fragile world.

Fang Ma studies the picture, a pang of something akin to peace settling in her chest. But then, a subtle unease creeps in. Despite the apparent happiness captured on the page, Fang Yuan’s own expression remains subdued, distant. Her brow furrows. **"My love,"** she asks softly, her gaze searching his, **"where are you in the picture?"** Yao Le and Fang Sianer, noticing his absence, echo the question. Fang Yuan opens his mouth, a silent struggle, words failing him. Unseen by the others, tears begin to well in Fang Yuan’s eyes.

Just then, the medicine hall elder enters the room. **"Good afternoon, Elder Fang Ma,"** she greets. Fang Ma offers a polite nod. **"I am well enough. How is Fang Yuan doing? Is my Yao Le causing any trouble?"** Fang Ma smiles faintly. **"Fang Yuan is improving, slowly. And Yao Le has been a great help."** Yao Le pipes up, **"Grandma, I told you not to worry! We are staying here with Sister Sianer, and we are both helping Brother Fang Yuan."** The elder smiles at her granddaughter. **"That’s good, my dear."** Her gaze then turns to Fang Yuan, who is still looking down at the drawing. **"How are you feeling, Fang Yuan?"** He doesn’t respond, seemingly lost in his own thoughts. Fang Ma explains gently, **"He can't talk properly yet. He's still healing."**

**"I hope he recovers fully soon,"** the medicine hall elder says, her tone sincere. **"Actually, the clan leader, along with the heads of the Chi and Mo factions, and their respective grandsons and granddaughter, have come to see Fang Yuan. They are waiting in the guest room. Servants are attending to them."** A worried expression crosses Fang Ma’s face. **"Fang Yuan isn't truly well. I don't know how he will react to seeing them all."** Yao Le’s grandmother reassures her, **"They won’t stay long. Just a brief visit. And they have brought some potent martial elixirs that might be beneficial."** With a sigh, Fang Ma says, **"Since they are already here, let them in."**

The medicine hall elder exits, and after a short while, the clan leader, the Chi faction head with his grandson, and the Mo faction head with his grandson and granddaughter enter the room. They offer polite greetings to Fang Ma, their voices carefully modulated, inquiring about Fang Yuan’s condition. Notably, none of them approach him directly to check on him physically. The lingering fear from the awakening ceremony, the memory of the unsettling encounter with his abnormal martial core, is palpable in their cautious distance. They present Fang Ma with several valuable martial elixirs, their words of concern polite but their movements subtly wary.

After a time, Fang Yuan’s unfocused gaze drifts towards the newcomers. As his eyes land on the clan leader, a jolt of pure terror rips through him. The pleasant drawing, the familiar faces, vanish. He is plunged back into the horrifying battlefield of his memories, but this time, it is the cold, authoritative figure of the clan leader he sees, a symbol of the rigid hierarchy he once scorned, the authority he ruthlessly defied. The memories flood in, sharp and brutal: the manipulation, the calculated betrayals, the disregard for life.

A strangled sob escapes Fang Yuan’s throat. He clutches his head, his breath coming in ragged gasps. His fingers clench, his nails digging into his skin. **"No… No…"** he whispers, his voice barely audible, his eyes wide with a dawning, visceral horror at the monster he remembers being. Then, his small hands, driven by an unseen force of self-destruction, lurch upwards. Before anyone can fully comprehend the change, before a word of alarm can be uttered, his fingers pierce his own flesh, tearing viciously at his face. One finger plunges deep into his eye, a sickening wet sound filling the stunned silence as blood and the milky white substance of his eyeball ooze out.

A collective gasp of horror fills the room. Yao Le and Fang Sianer, sitting closest to him, cry out, reaching to stop his self-mutilation. Fang Ma lunges forward, her face a mask of utter terror and despair. The visiting clan leader and the faction heads recoil in shock, their faces pale, as the idyllic scene turns into a horrifying spectacle.
