The memory continues, a relentless surge of terror. Yao Le runs, her small legs pumping, her lungs burning, a desperate, terrified flight through the dark, unforgiving jungle. Tears stream down her face, blurring the tangled undergrowth, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. She doesn't know how long she has been running, only that the terrifying sounds of the King Lightning Wolf and the final, heartbreaking cries of her protectors are fading behind her, leaving her utterly alone with her fear and the crushing weight of their sacrifice.

Lost and disoriented in the oppressive darkness of the jungle, a voice suddenly echoes in her mind, clear and distinct, cutting through the fog of her terror. _"Don't go straight. Turn left."_

She doesn't question it. Instinct, raw and primal, takes over. She unconsciously follows the instruction, veering sharply to the left. Moments later, she realizes she has narrowly avoided a group of lightning wolves, their eyes glowing like malevolent embers in the distance. The voice speaks again, guiding her, directing her to go in another direction. She follows, a desperate trust forming in this unseen guide. Fang Yuan, the cold, calculating observer in this memory, moves silently through the shadows, following Yao Le from a distance, his gaze fixed on her, his thoughts a chilling counterpoint to the terror that consumes her. He gives his instructions, subtle mental nudges, and Yao Le, lost and afraid, follows them blindly, her life now entirely in his hands, though she doesn't know it. After some time, guided by the voice, she finds herself before a dark opening in the rock face – a cave.

Relief washes over her, a fragile wave in the sea of her terror. A place to hide, a place to rest. But before she can fully process her surroundings, before she can even take a step into the cave, a figure emerges from the dark jungle behind her. She spins around, her heart leaping into her throat, her voice trembling as she calls out, a desperate hope in her eyes. _"Senior? Are you… are you the one who helped me? The one who guided me?"_

But the figure steps into the faint moonlight filtering through the trees, and her voice catches in her throat. Her eyes widen in disbelief, then in a renewed surge of terror. _"Fang Yuan!"_ she cries out, the name a question, an accusation, a desperate plea. _"You… you were the one who helped me?"_

Fang Yuan stands before her, his face impassive, his eyes cold and devoid of warmth. His voice, when he speaks, is chillingly detached, a cruel echo in the silent jungle. _"No,"_ he replies, his tone dismissive. _"I am just simply helping myself."_

_"What!"_ Yao Le asks, her voice filled with confusion and a dawning horror. His words make no sense, yet the coldness in his eyes speaks volumes.

But Fang Yuan doesn't answer. There is no explanation, no justification. With a blink of an eye, a movement too fast for her to follow, using some unseen martial parasite, he is behind her. A sharp, brutal strike to her neck. Pain explodes, then fades into darkness. Yao Le faints on the spot, her body slumping forward, her consciousness extinguished.

Then, the memory shifts. Fang Yuan holds Yao Le by her waist, his grip firm, and carries her into the dark cave. The air inside is damp and cold, the darkness absolute. There, in the suffocating blackness, he binds Yao Le's hands tightly behind her back with a rough rope. He then loops the rope around her neck, ensuring it is tight enough to restrict movement but not to choke her, and ties the other end to a large, immovable rock in the center of the cave. She is a prisoner, helpless and alone.

Fang Yuan leaves the cave, stepping back into the fading night. The hours pass slowly, marked by the gradual lightening of the sky. The night passes by quickly, and the morning sun begins to rise, casting a pale light into the entrance of the cave.

Yao Le wakes up slowly, her head throbbing, her body aching. Disorientation gives way to a terrifying realization – she is bound, her hands tied tightly behind her back, a rope around her neck tethering her to a rock. Panic flares, raw and visceral. She desperately tries to make herself free, straining against the ropes, her breath coming in ragged gasps, but the bindings are secure, unyielding. Fear, cold and sharp, grips her heart. What could possibly Fang Yuan do to her? Why would he do this after seemingly helping her escape?

Her mind races, trying to make sense of the senseless. _"Doesn't Fang Yuan want me to starve to death?"_ she ponders, the memory of her earlier complaint about his actions surfacing in her fear-addled mind. _"Because I complained about his wrongdoings?"_

Then, a flicker of fragile hope. _"Maybe… maybe he just wants to punish me for two or three days,"_ she thinks, clinging to the possibility. _"Maybe he'll just leave me here for a little while, and afterward, he'll let me go."_

But the fear remains, a cold knot in her stomach. Anger flares, hot and desperate. _"I will not forgive you, Fang Yuan!"_ she shouts, her voice raw with rage and terror, the words echoing in the silent cave. _"I will never forgive you for this! You will pay!"_

Then, she hears footsteps outside the cave entrance, slow and deliberate. Her heart skips a beat, a terrifying dread washing over her. _"Is it him?"_ she thinks, her mind conjuring horrifying possibilities. _"Does Fang Yuan… does he want to rape me? No! No, he can't! I will never forgive him! I will punish him for all his wrongdoings after I go back to the village! If I ever get back!"_

Fang Yuan slowly enters the cave, his figure silhouetted against the morning light. And behind him, moving obediently, is a large, dark bear, its eyes fixed on him.

Seeing Fang Yuan, seeing the coldness in his eyes, Yao Le’s last shred of composure shatters. _"Fang Yuan!"_ she shouts, her voice filled with a desperate plea and a futile attempt at defiance. _"Let me go now! Immediately! Otherwise, my grandmother will deal with you! You don't know who you're messing with!"_

Seeing her struggle against the ropes, her fear, her desperate defiance, Fang Yuan’s lips curve into a cold, cruel smile. _"You sure are lively,"_ he says, his voice devoid of any warmth, a chilling contrast to the terror in her eyes.

She is still crying, tears streaming down her face, a mixture of fear and rage contorting her features. But then, she sees the large bear moving obediently behind him, its massive form a silent, terrifying presence. Her eyes widen in shock, a new understanding dawning on her, adding another layer to her fear. _"So,"_ she whispers, her voice trembling, _"you… you used the Bear Enslave Martial Parasite! The one you exchanged for your merits! You used it… to enslave this large bear!"_

He laughs, a cold, humorless sound that echoes in the cave like an ominous wind. He stretches out his hand, his fingers brushing against the bear’s black fur, a chilling display of his control. His voice, when he speaks, is filled with a coldness that flows through the cave, a palpable sense of malice. _"Because of the wolf tide, it was not easy to find such a wild bear,"_ he says, his gaze fixed on Yao Le, his eyes cold and calculating. _"It took me lots of time and effort to find it. But it will be worth it."_

Yao Le’s mind races, trying to understand his twisted logic, his purpose. _"So,"_ she shouts, her voice trembling but filled with a desperate defiance, _"you want to make me fearful of you? You want to make me submit to you using this bear?"_ Then, her expression hardens, a cold look in her eyes that mirrors his own ruthlessness. _"Fang Yuan, let me go! Now! I will forget what you have done to me. I will pretend this never happened. Otherwise, you will see what my grandmother will do to you! You will regret this!"_

Fang Yuan leans towards Yao Le, a predatory gleam in his eyes. Seeing his movement, she struggles violently against the ropes, trying to pull away, her body twisting in a desperate attempt to escape his reach. _"Don't you dare to touch me!"_ she screams, her voice raw with terror.

But Fang Yuan doesn't care about her warning, her pleas. He reaches out and coldly grabs her cheeks, his fingers digging into her skin, holding her face firmly, forcing her to look at him. _"Such a cute appearance,"_ he says, his voice a chilling whisper, his eyes cold and indifferent. _"Lovable indeed."_

Yao Le is desperately trying to get away from him, her body twisting, her screams echoing in the cave. Then, with a sudden, brutal movement, Fang Yuan grabs the upper part of her dress and instantly tears it apart, the fabric ripping with a harsh sound, revealing her pink undergarment.

Yao Le is stunned into silence for a fraction of a second, her eyes wide with shock, before a raw, guttural scream tears from her throat. She struggles violently, desperately trying to protect her body, to hide herself from his gaze, from his touch. Now, she is one hundred percent certain. Her worst fears are confirmed. Fang Yuan is going to rape her.

He laughs, a cold, cruel sound that chills her to the bone, and continues to pull and tear at her clothing, ripping the fabric apart with brutal efficiency. Her beautiful dress is reduced to torn strips of cloth. Now, she is mostly in her upper and lower undergarments, her body exposed, vulnerable, covered only by a few torn remnants of her dress.

She is crying desperately, her body shaking uncontrollably, trying to hide herself, to cover her exposed skin from his gaze, from his touch. _"Don't touch me!"_ she screams, her voice raw with terror. _"Don't come near me! No! Let me go! Let me go!"_ She is extremely frightened, her screams echoing in the cave, her mind racing with horrifying possibilities. As she thinks of all the various ways Fang Yuan could violate her, her whole body shakes and trembles, a visceral reaction to the terror.

However, he does not continue on as she expected, as she feared. Instead, he stands up and moves backwards, away from her, his face still cold and impassive.

Her loud cries turn into choked sobs, the sudden cessation of his assault leaving her in a state of shock and confusion.

A fragile, desperate relief washes over her, but the terror remains, a cold knot in her stomach. She is still sobbing, her body trembling, but a flicker of defiance returns. _"Fang Yuan won't dare to rape me,"_ she thinks, clinging to this hope. _"At best, he's just trying to frighten me, to break my spirit."_

Thinking this, gathering her courage, Yao Le looks at him, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and defiance. _"Fang Yuan!"_ she shouts, her voice trembling but firm. _"You have already taken your revenge! You have humiliated me! I will not tell anyone about this if you let me go now! I promise! Just let me go!"_
