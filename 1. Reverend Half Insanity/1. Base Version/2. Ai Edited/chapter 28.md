After some time, they leave the grand mansion and head towards the clan pavilion. As they walk, Fang Ma pays special attention to Fang Yuan, holding his hand, her touch a silent anchor. Even though a bright, cheerful smile graces her lips, her eyes betray a hidden depth of worry, a subtle anxiety that she carefully masks. Fang Sianer, holding Fang Yuan's other hand, chatters happily, her voice like a sweet melody, her eyes reflecting only pure love and innocent happiness, completely free from worry or concern. A little behind them, Fang Zheng and Shen Cui walk hand in hand, their conversation punctuated by shy laughter and blushing cheeks, a youthful romance beginning to blossom.

As they walk through the streets, villagers emerge from their homes and shops, their faces lighting up with respect and affection. One by one, they come forward to pay their respects, their greetings directed especially towards Fang Yuan, calling him by his beloved title, the **"Messenger of Love."** They offer heartfelt wishes that he will awaken a high talent, their hopes for his future intertwined with their gratitude for his past kindness. Thanks to Fang Ma's careful efforts, everyone in the village now pays more attention to Fang Yuan and holds him in high esteem.

After some time, they reach the clan pavilion, a grand structure nestled in the heart of the village. Over a hundred youths, their faces a mixture of nervousness and excitement, are already gathered. Seeing them arrive, Yao Ji, Yao Le's grandmother and the current medicine hall leader, and Yao Le herself come forward. They exchange warm greetings, a sense of mutual respect evident between Fang Ma and Yao Ji, and a shy anticipation between Fang Yuan and Yao Le. Yao Le, her cheeks flushing, keeps her gaze lowered slightly as she looks at Fang Yuan, her heart fluttering with a young girl's crush.

Fang Ma gathers the children around her, her voice gentle but firm. _"Okay, my loves. You all go together now. Mama and Yao Le's grandmother will be sitting at the elders' place and will watch you from there. Remember,"_ she says, her gaze sweeping over her children and Shen Cui, her voice carrying a note of unwavering support, _"no matter what your talent is, don't be sad. There are many ways to increase one's talent and power, as you know."_

Fang Zheng and Shen Cui instinctively stick together, their hands finding each other. Fang Yuan and Fang Sianer stand side by side, and with a shy smile, Yao Le joins them, siding beside Fang Sianer.

Fang Sianer, ever observant of beauty, turns to Yao Le, her eyes sparkling. _"Brother, look,"_ she says, her voice filled with admiration, _"Yao Le looks so pretty and beautiful in her dress."_ Hearing this, Yao Le's heart starts beating faster and faster, and her blush deepens, a wave of embarrassment and shy pleasure washing over her. Fang Yuan smiles warmly at both of them. _"Yes, My Sianer,"_ he says, his voice gentle, _"She looks really beautiful. And you also look really beautiful, My Sianer."_ Fang Sianer beams. _"Thank you, brother!"_ Yao Le whispers, her voice barely audible, _"Thank you, Messenger of Love."_

Most of the other boys and girls gathered watch their group with interest, a mix of curiosity and admiration in their eyes. A girl, gathering her courage, steps forward, her voice filled with heartfelt gratitude as she addresses Fang Yuan. _"Messenger of Love,"_ she says, her eyes shining, _"we requested you to allow us to the awakening ceremony, to awaken our talent, and I honestly thought it might only be possible from next year. But I am truly surprised and so grateful to you for showing us such incredible kindness and making it happen for this year!"_

Then, a group of boys and girls, their faces alight with admiration, come forwards, their voices rising in a chorus of praise and gratitude for Fang Yuan's kindness and compassion. Fang Sianer and Yao Le stand beside him, their faces also reflecting happiness, seeing their loved one being praised so highly by everyone.

Suddenly, the atmosphere shifts. The group of orphanage girls and boys, their faces etched with a fierce determination that borders on reverence, move forward. They kneel down before Fang Yuan, their voices rising in a uniform declaration that silences the surrounding chatter. **_"Oh! Messenger of Love!"_** they declare as one, their voices filled with profound emotion. **_"You have given us hope when we were in despair, with no hope for our future. You not only showed us the light, you gave it to us, and even showed us the path to walk! So, we have all decided that from today onward… we are your servants! Not only we, but also our future generations… will serve you! Messenger of Love!"_**

This dramatic scene makes everyone in the courtyard gasp, startled by the intensity of their declaration. Many have bowed before Fang Yuan before, offering their service, but this time, it is a large group, their eyes sparkling with unwavering loyalty and a shared purpose.

Fang Yuan, his eyes wide with surprise, quickly steps forward, his hand outstretched, urging them to rise. _"No! Please, get up!"_ he says, his voice filled with earnestness. _"You don't have to do this! You have your own lives to live, your own futures to build! You are not servants!"_ He looks at them, his brow furrowed with concern. _"My mother taught me that if you are strong or have wealth, that means there is a reason why you have that, and she said that reason is to help those who are weak and vulnerable. That is our responsibility!"_

The group remains kneeling, their determination unwavering. **_"We will not stand,"_** they declare together, their voices resolute, **_"until you accept us as your slaves!"_**

Fang Yuan’s eyes widen in shock and anger. **_"What are you saying!"_** he shouts, his voice filled with a righteous indignation that surprises even himself. **_"My mother taught me to never make anyone a slave, to value human dignity! She told me that the current world is a bad place because people are making others slaves, which is a violation of everything that is right! How can you ask me to do such a bad thing? Haven't you seen how many slaves I have freed? It was understandable when you wanted to serve me and become my servants out of gratitude, but now you want to become my slaves? How can you force me to do something I fundamentally believe is wrong and evil?"_**

Hearing his passionate words, a wave of astonishment washes over everyone gathered. Yao Le looks at Fang Yuan, her eyes filled with even deeper love and admiration, her heart swelling with pride. Other girls in the crowd also gaze at him, their expressions reflecting adoration; they had all fallen in love with the kind and gentle Messenger of Love a long time ago. Boys look at Fang Yuan with awe and hope, dreaming that one day they might be worthy enough to serve him and become his trusted subordinates.

Fang Sianer, her eyes wide with excitement, clutches Fang Yuan's hand and shouts with boundless enthusiasm, _"Brother, you are really kind and awesome! The best brother in the world!"_

The crowd, swept up in the emotion of the moment, erupts in spontaneous applause. Their cheers rise, a wave of admiration and support. **_"Long Live the Messenger of Love! Long live the Messenger of Love!"_** they shout, their voices filled with respect and adoration.

The orphan group, hearing Fang Yuan's impassioned words and the resounding support from the crowd, bow their heads further, a sense of guilt washing over them. They feel foolish for their misguided declaration, thinking themselves useless and pathetic, unworthy of Fang Yuan's love and kindness.

Then, Fang Yuan, his voice filled with determination and compassion, addresses the orphan group and the entire assembly. **_"I know many of you are feeling indebted to me for helping you!"_** he says loudly, his voice carrying sincerity and conviction. **_"If you truly feel that, if you really want to do something in return, then do something that will help others who are in need, just as you were before! That is what my mother taught me! And I will follow that teaching until my last breath!"_**

A renewed wave of applause and shouts of his name erupts from the crowd, their admiration for him deepening with every word.

An elder, who had been watching the entire exchange with a thoughtful expression, steps forward, his voice filled with genuine respect. **_"That is really kind of you, Messenger of Love. I am truly moved by your teachings and your actions."_**

Fang Yuan smiles humbly, his gaze directed at his mother. **_"Thank you,"_** he replies, **_"but this is just what my mother taught me. She is the one who showed me the importance of kindness and helping others."_**
