Overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of everything he has faced in such a short period – the terrifying flood of his previous life's memories, the agonizing despair of that past existence, the shock of his future demonic self attempting to merge with him, the instinctive rejection of that darkness upon sensing Fang Sianer's pure love, the horror of his future self's attempt to kill Fang Sianer through his own hands, the desperate struggle to regain control of his mind, the chilling realization of what he almost did, the crushing despair of losing all hope as the terrorizing memories resurfaced, the desperate clinging to his mother and sister as his only reason to live, the violent battle for control within his own body, the terrifying voice that spoke directly into his soul, a voice so chilling it made his very essence tremble, the final, terrifying words that confirmed the awakening of a demonic martial core – it is all too much. His mind, his body, his very soul, cannot bear the weight of it all. As he clings to Fang Sianer, wrapped in the comforting embrace of his mother, the world spins and tilts. The terrifying voice, the horrifying memories, the chilling darkness – it all fades away.

Fang Yuan faints on the spot, collapsing completely in the arms of his mother and sister, his small body going limp, finally finding a temporary escape from the storm raging within him.

Time passes, marked by the slow descent of the sun outside the cave. It is now evening. Fang Yuan lies still in a quiet room in their mansion, a room typically used by the maids, converted temporarily into a sickroom. The air is thick with a hushed worry. The medicine hall leader, Yao Ji, along with several other elders from the medicine hall, are gathered around the bed, their faces etched with concern as they continuously check Fang Yuan's condition, their brows furrowed in bewilderment. Fang Sianer and Yao Le stand near the bed, their young faces pale with worry. Fang Sianer is still sobbing quietly, her small body trembling with the lingering fear and sorrow, her eyes red and swollen, while Yao Le stands beside her, gently rubbing her back, her own eyes filled with sympathy, trying to offer what little comfort she can.

The medicine hall leader, Yao Ji, her voice filled with a professional concern mixed with a deep personal worry for the boy she cares about, speaks to Fang Ma, who sits by Fang Yuan's side, holding his hand. _"Mistress Fang Ma,"_ she says, her tone respectful despite Fang Ma's lack of martial power, _"the result is the same after every examination. He has no physical injury that we can detect, nothing broken, nothing bleeding. But his martial core… it is abnormal. Terribly abnormal."_ She hesitates, her gaze troubled, unable to hide the unease she feels. _"The martial core and martial essence should be a pure, bright white color when awakened, a symbol of potential and purity. But his martial core… it is black. Completely, unnervingly black."_

With a visible bit of hesitation, she continues, her voice lower now, a hint of fear in her tone. _"As the other elders mentioned when they first examined him in the cave, his martial core makes me… very uncomfortable as I tried to investigate it further. It feels… wrong. Just like the other elders, I have only been able to take a brief look, a superficial examination. I cannot fully investigate it; it feels… dangerous."_

Fang Ma’s face is calm, a mask of composure, but her eyes hold a deep, unwavering concern, a mother's fear for her child's unknown future. _"Okay, thank you, Yao Ji,"_ she says, her voice steady despite the turmoil in her heart. _"Please, get some rest now. You and the elders have done enough."_

The medicine hall leader nods, her gaze lingering on Fang Yuan's still form, a mixture of pity and fear in her eyes. _"I think he will be fine after some rest, Mistress Fang Ma,"_ she says, though her tone lacks complete conviction, the abnormality of the black core weighing heavily on her.

_"I hope so,"_ Fang Ma replies softly, her eyes fixed on her son, a silent prayer in her heart.

The medicine hall leader turns to Yao Le, her voice gentle. _"Yao Le, let's go. We will come back later to check on his condition."_

Yao Le’s eyes widen, and she looks at her grandmother with a pleading expression, her gaze then flicking to the sobbing Fang Sianer. _"Grandma, can't I stay here with Fang Sianer?"_ she asks hesitantly, her voice filled with concern for her friend.

The medicine hall leader sighs, her voice gentle but firm, thinking of the potential trouble a young girl might cause in such a delicate situation. _"You will be no help here, Yao Le, and you might only cause trouble."_

Yao Le’s resolve hardens, her desire to comfort Fang Sianer outweighing her shyness. _"No! I won't cause trouble! Look at Fang Sianer's condition, Grandma. She is totally broken and upset. I will stay and take care of her, I promise I won't get in the way. I just want to be here for her."_

Fang Ma, seeing the genuine concern in Yao Le's eyes and the comfort she is already providing to Fang Sianer simply by being there, intervenes gently. _"Okay, Yao Ji,"_ she says, a small, grateful smile touching her lips. _"Let her stay. She will be emotional support to Fang Sianer; they are pretty good friends, after all. It will help Sianer to have her friend here."_ The medicine hall leader nods in agreement, a silent acknowledgment of the bond between the two girls, and with a final, worried glance at Fang Yuan, she leads the other elders out of the room, leaving Fang Ma, Fang Sianer, and Yao Le to watch over the sleeping Fang Yuan, a small circle of love and worry in the quiet room.
