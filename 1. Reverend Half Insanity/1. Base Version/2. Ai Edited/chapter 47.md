Before Fang Ma and Fang Sianer can fully process what just happened to Yao Le, before they can even reach her fallen form, a chilling, ancient voice vibrates in Fang Yuan's mind again. It is a sound that tears at his soul, a sound filled with utter contempt and cold, cruel mockery.

_**"Look at you!"**_ the voice sneers, its tone dripping with disdain. _**"Making yourself a fool again and again. This time, your forceful integration with your younger self was slow, yes, but it was progressing at a steady phase. But the progress has been heavily interrupted again and again by your so-called mother. She is a persistent nuisance."**_ The voice pauses, and then its tone shifts, a chilling surprise replacing the contempt. _**"But you were still making progress… until those two girls. Especially _that_ one, your so-called sister."**_ A wave of cold, malevolent hatred directed at Fang Sianer surges through the voice. _**"She has just undone your progress, most of it. And if she does it a few more times, your all progress will be undone, and you won't be able to use this forceful method in the future anymore. Look at your condition,"**_ the voice mocks, its contempt returning, _**"you look so pathetic now, a mere shadow, as you have already used up so much of your power as a mere remnant will and memories."**_

The words, simple as they are, detonate in Fang Yuan's mind like nuclear bombs. His body starts trembling violently, uncontrollably, as if struck by an invisible force. Fear, raw and absolute, is eminent on his face, contorting his features into a mask of pure terror. Even though those words were spoken only in his mind, the sheer, horrifying impact of them is visible to anyone observing him. The violent trembling, the wide, fear-filled eyes – anyone can imagine how terrifying the sound, the voice, must have been just by observing his reaction.

Fang Ma, her heart lurching with renewed fear, quickly reaches the fallen Yao Le, gently lifting her up and laying her beside Fang Yuan on the bed. Then, she rushes back to Fang Yuan, pulling him into her arms along with Fang Sianer. They hold him tightly, their bodies shaking with shared fear and desperation. _"Please! Please!"_ Fang Ma cries, her voice thick with tears, clinging to her son. _"Please, my love, don't be afraid! We are here!"_ Fang Sianer joins her mother, tears streaming down her face, holding onto Fang Yuan, repeating, _"Please! Please, brother! Come back to us!"_ As time passes by, Fang Yuan's condition remains the same, a terrifying cycle of violent trembling and a face frozen in fear. Their crying has turned into ragged sobbing, their voices hoarse with desperation as they cling to him, desperately trying to anchor him, to pull him back from the abyss that has claimed him.

Suddenly, in a moment of fierce, desperate determination, Fang Sianer’s voice rings out, cutting through the despair. _"Mama,"_ she shouts, her eyes fixed on her mother, a desperate plan forming in her mind. _"Inject your martial essence… into my martial core! I have no martial essence left after channeling into Brother!"_

Fang Ma’s eyes widen in shock. _"What!"_ she cries out, unable to comprehend her daughter's words.

_"Mama, please!"_ Fang Sianer shouts again, tears streaming down her face, her voice a plea and a command. _"Just insert your martial essence! Now! I have to help him!"_

Seeing Fang Sianer's desperate and determined face, the fierce love in her eyes that mirrors her own, and sensing the urgency in her scream, Fang Ma makes a split-second decision. Trusting her daughter implicitly, driven by a mother's desperate hope, she reaches out and starts injecting her primeval essence into Fang Sianer's martial core through holding her hands, just as Sianer had done with Yao Le.

As Fang Ma's martial essence, her pure, transparent white energy, starts passing through the wall of Fang Sianer's martial core, Fang Ma is astonished. Her essence is changing, the slight white glow transforming into a slight green glow, taking on the color and properties of Fang Sianer's unique essence. And she feels that she is losing complete control over those martial essences, they are no longer solely hers; they are flowing through Fang Sianer, guided by Sianer's will. But after a few breaths, a new sensation emerges. She feels that she can observe what Fang Sianer is doing with her essence, seeing through Sianer's eyes, as it were. She becomes terrified as she notices that Fang Sianer is directly taking all that infused green martial essence, all that hope-infused energy, and channeling it into Fang Yuan's terrifying black martial core. She instantly braces herself, preparing to feel the soul-crushing fear of being devoured alive, the terrifying sensation she experienced each time she tried to connect with his core. But to her astonishment, the overwhelming fear doesn't come. Instead, she simply loses all direct connection with that martial essence, the green energy flowing into the black void. But her consciousness, her will, has safely retreated, unharmed, pulled back from the edge of the abyss by the protective aura of Fang Sianer's essence.

Hours pass by quickly, blurring into a relentless cycle of desperate effort. Fang Ma has drained her martial essence completely several times from her martial core, using martial elixirs to replenish it quickly, and then, without interrupting the flow, injecting it again and again into Fang Sianer's martial core. She is panting very heavily now, her body aching with exhaustion, and Fang Sianer is also panting, her face pale with strain. Fang Ma's condition looks worse, the fear a permanent resident in her eyes, but the good thing, the miraculous thing, is that Fang Yuan has completely stopped trembling after hours of their combined, desperate work. But the fear is still visible in his facial expression, a haunting shadow that lingers even in stillness. They have calmed the storm, but they haven't yet reached the shore.
