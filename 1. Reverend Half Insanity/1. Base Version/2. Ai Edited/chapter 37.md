Now it is almost bedtime. The quiet room is illuminated by the soft glow of a single lamp. The servants, despite their eagerness to help, haven't had a chance to do much for Fang Ma; Fang Sianer and Yao Le have taken on the roles of vigilant caregivers, their youthful energy fueled by concern. They fetch water, adjust blankets, and sit by Fang Yuan's bedside, their presence a silent comfort.

Fang Ma looks at the two girls, a gentle smile on her face. _"You two,"_ she says softly, _"go and sleep in the other room. It's bedtime, you must be tired."_

Fang Sianer shakes her head vehemently, her eyes fixed on Fang Yuan. _"No, Mama,"_ she argues, her voice firm despite the weariness that must be settling in. _"The bed is very big; we can all fit. But the most important thing is, I'm not tired at all. I want to see my love open his eyes. I want to be here when he wakes up."_

Fang Ma’s smile is tinged with a hint of sadness, but her voice remains gentle. _"Your love might not wake up tonight, my dear. But his condition is much better now. Look,"_ she says, gesturing towards Fang Yuan, _"after all that time, he's breathing properly now, and his body has stopped trembling. It looks like he's finally having a peaceful sleep."_

Fang Sianer is not swayed. _"I will stay by my love's side,"_ she insists, her resolve unwavering.

Fang Ma turns to Yao Le, her expression kind. _"How about you, Yao Le? I think you should go and get some proper sleep."_

Yao Le, her gaze also fixed on Fang Yuan, responds without hesitation. _"I will be okay, Mistress Fang Ma. I will stay by sister Fang Sianer's side. We will wait for brother Fang Yuan together."_

Fang Ma’s heart softens. She sees the genuine care in their eyes, the silent promise to stay by his side. _"Okay,"_ she says, her voice filled with warmth. _"Then Fang Sianer, sleep here beside your love, on this side, and Yao Le, you sleep beside Fang Sianer, on that side. You can share the bed."_

_"Okay!"_ Fang Sianer agrees readily, her face lighting up slightly despite her exhaustion.

And then they settle down on the large bed. Fang Sianer lies down carefully beside Fang Yuan, her small body a warm presence next to his. Yao Le lies down beside Fang Sianer, completing the small circle of vigilant care.

Fang Ma is sitting on a chair nearby, her gaze fixed on Fang Yuan's face, watching his chest rise and fall with steady breaths. From time to time, she reaches out and gently strokes his hair, her touch a silent expression of her love and worry. Occasionally, she leans down and presses a soft kiss to his forehead.

As Fang Ma strokes Fang Yuan's hair and gazes at her son's face, a cascade of thoughts runs through her mind, a mix of relief, worry, and a profound, unsettling mystery. _"It is a kind of miracle that I have reawakened my talent,"_ she ponders, reflecting on the events of the day, _"and even more astonishing is that my talent is 100%, something called Extreme Physique, according to the Clan Leader. Fang Sianer has also awakened her talent, and it is also 100%, but hers is different from mine, and the Clan Leader stated that she might have also awakened an Extreme Physique, though of a different nature. The most abnormal thing is our martial cores. Even though mine and Sianer's martial cores and martial essence are normal in their basic function, their appearance is… unusual."_

She recalls the examination by the elders. _"My martial core is almost transparent in color, with only a slight white glow, and it feels normal, just as a martial core should. As one ranks up, their martial core and martial essence become more dense, their color more saturated, radiating a heavier, brighter white glow. The color of my martial essence and martial core is very light, very transparent white; it's almost like clear water with a faint white luminescence. All other conditions are alright with Fang Sianer, except for the fact that her martial core and martial essence are green. It is now very transparent, just like mine, but instead of glowing white, it emits a gentle, vibrant green light. But the most abnormal condition… is Fang Yuan's."_

Her gaze intensifies as she looks at her son, her heart aching with worry. _"His martial core and essence isn't glowing at all. It is transparent, just like ours, but with a shadowy color, a deep, unsettling gray. And more importantly, no one, not even the most experienced elders, can investigate his martial core. It gives off a very uncomfortable and dangerous feeling, a chilling sensation that is completely in contrast to Fang Sianer's martial core, which gives off a very warm and gentle feeling, a sense of peace and comfort."_

Then Fang Ma leans down and kisses Fang Yuan's forehead again, a silent promise in her heart. _"My son! My love!"_ she whispers, her voice filled with fierce determination. _"Don't worry! No matter what happens, no matter what darkness you carry, I will always be at your side. I will protect you."_

But the very next moment, the mask of determination cracks. She quietly cries out, a heavy sigh escaping her lips, her voice thick with fear and sorrow. _"Oh, my son! Oh, my love! I am feeling really afraid. Please… please don't leave me. I am feeling that my heart is being crushed, bit by bit, by this fear."_

Hearing their mother's distress, Fang Sianer and Yao Le stir. Fang Sianer cries out, her voice filled with empathy and reassurance. _"Mama! Don't worry! Nothing would happen to our love!"_

Yao Le also cries out, her voice filled with support. _"Yes, Mistress Fang Ma, nothing bad will happen to brother Fang Yuan. He is strong."_

In Fang Yuan’s mind, a chilling, familiar voice cuts through the darkness of sleep. _**"I think now you can hear me."**_ The voice is cold, ancient, filled with a terrifying indifference that freezes his blood. _**"I am your future self. And I have come back from the future, carrying all the memories of the future. It is really amazing how many things have changed beyond recognition… including my younger self. We will merge together… either way… peacefully… or forcefully."**_

Hearing this voice, this chilling declaration of intent, Fang Yuan’s eyes snap open. He jumps up from the bed, a strangled gasp escaping his lips, his body rigid with shock and fear. He is startled, terrified by the voice that has invaded his mind.

Fang Ma is instantly by his side, her arms wrapping around him, pulling him into a fierce embrace. _"My love, don't worry,"_ she murmurs, her voice filled with the comforting presence of a mother. _"Mama is here. You are safe."_ Seeing Fang Ma, feeling her familiar embrace, Fang Yuan hugs her back desperately, seeking refuge, seeking comfort in her arms, his body still trembling slightly.

From behind them, Fang Sianer’s voice rings out, filled with joy and relief. _"My love, you have finally awakened!"_

Sensing Fang Sianer's voice, the sound of her pure, unwavering love, Fang Yuan looks back over his shoulder, his gaze drawn to her, an unconscious act, perhaps his subconscious mind recalling the horrifying moment in the River of Flowers, how he had tried to crush her neck with his own hands.

Then, Fang Yuan looks at Fang Sianer’s neck. His eyes widen in horror as he sees the faint, red marks – the deep indentation of his own hands from the terrifying moments in the cave. Seeing this physical evidence of what he almost did, immense guilt washes over him, crushing him with its weight.

Sensing Fang Yuan’s sudden change in demeanor, the shift from fear to guilt, Fang Sianer, her eyes filled with only love and concern, reaches out and gently touches the marks on her neck. _"Don't worry, my love!"_ she says, her voice soft and reassuring. _"This is nothing! It doesn't hurt! I am just really, really happy that you have woken up and you are okay!"_

Fang Ma, sensing the wave of guilt radiating from Fang Yuan, her heart aching for his pain, adds, her voice filled with gentle reassurance, _"Don't worry, my love. Fang Sianer is completely fine. We are just so, so happy that you have come back to us."_

Before Fang Yuan can fully process everything, the terrifying voice, the horrifying memories, the guilt of his actions, Yao Le’s voice breaks through the emotional intensity. _"Hi, brother Fang Yuan,"_ she says shyly, her face pale with worry but a small smile on her lips. _"I am really happy that you are fine. I… I was really worried about you."_

As Fang Yuan sees Yao Le, as his eyes meet hers, something profound changes within him. Her face, her voice, her presence – it triggers something deep within his mind. A flood of memories, different from the terrifying ones of his past life, begins to surface, overwhelming him, pulling him back into the depths of his subconscious. He feels himself sinking again, not into despair memories of his previous life, but into a new wave of memories of his future life.
