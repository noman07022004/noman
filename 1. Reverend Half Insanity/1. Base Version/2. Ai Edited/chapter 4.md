The baby laughs like a devil, his voice sharp and triumphant, **"I am free! I am free! I’ve finally escaped that suffocating prison! Ha ha ha!"** His laughter echoes with a strange, almost eerie joy, as if he’s tasted freedom for the very first time.

Fang Ma’s heart swells with overwhelming joy as her baby laughs, the sound pure and infectious. She clutches him tightly, her voice trembling with excitement, **"Look! Our child is laughing instead of crying—this is extraordinary! Ha ha ha!"** Her eyes glisten with tears of happiness, her entire being radiating with pride and wonder.

The atmosphere feels light, serene, almost magical. Fang Fu steps closer, his voice soft but filled with awe as he takes the baby into his arms. **"My dear, he really is laughing. Heaven has truly blessed us with a miracle."** His hands tremble slightly as he cradles the child, his heart bursting with gratitude.

Then, raising his voice, he calls out, **"Hey, is anyone here? Come quickly! You must see this!"** His words ring with urgency, demanding attention.

Within moments, several maids rush in, their presence lighting up the room as they tidy up. The air buzzes with energy, but the baby remains the center of attention, his tiny form resting in Fang Fu’s lap. Yet, his gaze locks onto Fang Ma’s face, his eyes wide with curiosity and something deeper—**a longing, a recognition.** He thinks, **"Who is this beautiful, elegant lady? Her smile is so warm, so gentle. I want to touch her, to feel that warmth for myself."**

Everyone freezes, stunned, as the newborn gazes intensely at his mother. The baby begins to move his hands toward Fang Ma, soft cooing sounds escaping his lips. Inside, however, he is screaming, **"Let me go to her! Let me go!"** Seeing her fills him with an overwhelming sense of peace, a calm he has never known.

Fang Ma’s heart melts as she takes the baby back into her arms. She kisses him tenderly, each kiss sending waves of **pure, unbridled love, peace, and affection** through his tiny body. It’s as if every touch from her fills him with **all the positive emotions imaginable—gentleness, security, and an indescribable sense of belonging.**

Fang Fu watches them, his eyes soft with adoration. **"The baby truly adores you,"** he murmurs, his voice thick with emotion. **"Look how he brushes his tiny hands against your face. He already knows you’re his safe haven."**

Suddenly, Fang Ma gasps, her eyes widening in realization. **“I’ve completely forgotten! I should be breastfeeding him right after birth!”** She adjusts the baby in her arms, guiding him to her breast. The baby latches on immediately, his tiny mouth sucking with a surprising, almost desperate intensity.

To the baby, the experience is nothing short of miraculous. The milk is warm, sweet, and comforting—**the most divine thing he’s ever tasted.** Though his memories are hazy, fragmented, he knows instinctively that this is nourishment, safety, and love all in one. His body relaxes, his mind growing fuzzy as the exhaustion of his journey catches up to him.

He falls asleep while nursing, his emotional state a whirlwind of confusion and wonder. He doesn’t yet realize he has been reborn. The reason is clear: **he has been trapped in darkness for what felt like an eternity,** kicking and swimming tirelessly in a void. When he emerged, the world was dim, but now his eyes widen in astonishment at seeing something other than endless blackness. Looking at Fang Ma gives him a feeling of gentleness he has never known—a sensation so foreign it eclipses all prior experiences. When she kisses him, it floods him with **unimaginable love, peace, and happiness.** And when she feeds him, the surge of tenderness, security, and warmth causes his body and mind to shut down automatically, lulling him into a deep, peaceful slumber.

The baby continues to nurse even in sleep, his tiny body curled against Fang Ma. She looks down at him, radiant with joy, and whispers, **"How about we call him Fang Yuan?"**

Fang Fu’s voice is gentle but filled with conviction as he responds, **"That is a wonderful choice. ‘Fang Yuan’ can mean ‘the source of direction’ and ‘the origin of correctness.’ Your naming is profound. In the future, our child Fang Yuan may become the guiding light for those who lose their way and the embodiment of justice for those who deserve retribution—for this world, and perhaps even for heaven and earth."**

Fang Ma nods, her voice steady but brimming with emotion. **"I didn’t plan it consciously, but when I held him, I just knew. Deep inside, I felt that one day, he would be the source of direction and the origin of correctness."** Her words carry a weight, a certainty that feels almost prophetic.

Then she looks down at Fang Yuan, her heart overflowing with love. **"My child, Fang Yuan,"** she murmurs, her voice trembling with affection, **"one day, you will guide those who wander lost and bring clarity to those shrouded in confusion. You will punish wrongdoing with fairness and mercy. Oh, my precious boy, I am so proud of you already. No matter what happens, your mother will always stand by your side. Always."**

The room falls silent, the only sound the soft, rhythmic breathing of the sleeping baby. Fang Fu wraps an arm around Fang Ma, pulling her close. Together, they watch over their child, their hearts filled with hope, love, and the unshakable belief that Fang Yuan is destined for greatness.
