The next morning, after a quiet breakfast, Fang Ma is dressed for the academy, her expression a carefully masked worry. Yao Le and Fang Sianer, however, radiate a nervous excitement. Soon, the small group sets off: Fang Yuan, Fang Sianer, Yao Le, Fang Zheng, and Shen Cui walking together, with Fang Ma keeping a watchful eye from a short distance, accompanied by several discreet servants.

News of Fang Yuan’s reappearance spreads quickly. People who haven’t seen him or Fang Ma in months, fueled by rumors of his illness, rush towards them with a mixture of curiosity and concern. They gather around the group, yet maintain a respectful distance, a silent acknowledgment of Fang Yuan’s fragile state. Questions about his well-being ripple through the crowd. But as Fang Yuan’s gaze sweeps over the many faces, a familiar fear flickers across his features, silent tears welling in his eyes, a subtle tremor returning to his limbs.

Fang Ma instantly senses his distress. She swiftly moves to his side, placing a comforting arm around his shoulders. **"We are getting late for the academy,"** she says, her voice calm but firm, addressing the crowd. **"Please give us some space. Fang Yuan isn't quite himself yet."** To her surprise, the crowd immediately disperses, respecting her request, creating a clear path. **"Don't worry, my love,"** Fang Ma murmurs to Fang Yuan, squeezing his shoulder gently. **"Everything will be alright."**

As they enter the academy grounds, a torrent of memories assaults Fang Yuan. He sees himself manipulating a respected elder with cunning words, extorting martial stones from terrified peers, even his own brother falling victim to his callousness. The casual cruelty, the self-serving ambition – it all floods back, each memory a sharp, painful shard.

They approach the academy gates. A guard, recognizing Fang Ma, steps forward with a respectful greeting, offering assistance. But as Fang Yuan looks at the guard, another memory surfaces: the brutal beating he inflicted, the guard’s broken hands and fingers, dragging his near-lifeless body into a lecture hall. He recalls his arrogant justification to the shocked elder, claiming the guard had disturbed his breakthrough and disrespected their ancestors, his twisted logic somehow earning him not punishment, but reward.

Fang Yuan stands amidst these resurfacing horrors, his body shaking, but he holds himself upright. There is no outward cry, no madness, just a silent, internal battle. It is as if a grim resilience is hardening within him. Having glimpsed the depths of his past cruelty, these lesser acts, while still disturbing, don’t elicit the same visceral breakdown. It is a chilling adaptation, a mind becoming accustomed to the darkness within.

They continue deeper into the academy, Fang Ma’s protective presence a silent shield, Fang Yuan walking amidst his peers, a ghost haunted by the echoes of his former self.
