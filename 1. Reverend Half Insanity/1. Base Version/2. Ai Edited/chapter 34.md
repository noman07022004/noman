Fang Yuan comes out of his memory, the horrifying flood of his past life receding, leaving him utterly exposed and raw. He is no longer in the fairy tale cave; he is back in the abyss. He looks extremely terrified, his whole body shaking violently, his eyes wide open with shock and a deep-seated horror that chills him to the bone. He has taken only a few steps into the river of flowers, and now, his legs give out, collapsing beneath him. He falls onto the riverbed, the cool water splashing around him, but he doesn't feel the coolness.

The river of flowers is a place of breathtaking beauty, a hidden world where hope thrives and dreams take flight. Its water level hovers just above ankle but below knee, shimmering with the soft glow of countless hope martial parasites. Luminous fish dart gracefully among the vibrant, glowing flowers rooted in the riverbed. Tiny, radiant bugs play on the surface, their light twinkling like miniature stars. Every element here—the flowers, the bugs, the fishes, even the water itself, and the very rocks that form the riverbed—all glow dimly. They are, in truth, various kinds of hope martial parasites, carriers of potential and light.

They contain the very essence of hope. As someone walks through them, they begin to glow more brightly, their radiance intensifying, fueled by the hope that the person carries within their heart. The more hope a person carries, the more hope martial parasites gather around them, their light growing brighter and brighter, creating a shimmering halo. But as they gather with increasing brightness, they create a corresponding pressure on the person. The higher a person's natural-born talent, the greater the pressure they attract. This pressure of hope helps them to open their martial talents, to awaken the potential dormant within them. In simple terms, someone's talent is like electricity, and these hope martial parasites are like lights; the stronger the current (talent), the brighter the lights (hope parasites) will glow, revealing the path forward. There are many methods to awaken someone's martial talents, and this is one of them, but in every case, there is an undeniable need for hope to awaken one's potential.

As he collapses, he uses his two hands, unknowingly, instinctively, to brace himself before him, preventing himself from sinking completely, leaving him in a kneeling position in the shallow water. The sight is astonishing, a chilling anomaly in this place of light. He has gathered not a single hope martial parasite around him. Even more astonishing, all the hope martial parasites that _can_ run away—the bugs and the fishes—are darting away from him, scattering in every direction as if fleeing from a confirmed doom, a palpable sense of fear radiating from them. And then, the horrifying part unfolds. All the hope martial parasites that cannot run away, those that are rooted in place—the beautiful flowers around him, the rocks beneath him, the water itself—not only lose their dim, beautiful glow, but they begin to become darker and darker, a chilling, suffocating blackness spreading outwards. It starts like a virus, a dark stain originating from Fang Yuan's kneeling point, rapidly spreading around him, making the other hope martial parasites lose their beautiful dim light, extinguishing their very essence.

The whole ecosystem of the river of flowers has already started transforming, the vibrant dim light giving way to a suffocating blackness, as if the very essence of hope itself has been poisoned, devoured by the abyss of his despair. It is as if hope itself has fallen into despair, unable to withstand the crushing weight of Fang Yuan's overwhelming anguish, his soul a black hole of suffering.

Now, Fang Yuan's face and eyes reflect a despair so profound it seems to have consumed him entirely. His gaze is empty, haunted, as if he lost hope long before this moment, leaving behind only a living shell, a body moving solely by the raw, agonizing power of the abyss of despair that has engulfed him. His condition is justifiable, a direct consequence of the unimaginable trauma he endured in his previous life. After losing his wife and daughters in such a tragic and brutal fate, after witnessing the unspeakable, he had desperately clung to the belief that he could prevent other girls and women from facing similar horrors. But no matter how much he tried, how much he sacrificed, he couldn't stop it. He couldn't prevent the darkness. At best, he could only provide justice _after_ the damage was done, after innocent lives were shattered. Anyone in this situation, anyone who truly saw the endless cycle of brutality and suffering, would likely go mad from despair.

And this is the very condition of Fang Yuan right now. He has fallen, once again, into the abyss of despair that he was in before reincarnation, the darkness he thought he had escaped. The world, he knows from his past life, is a very dark place. If you look closely, if you truly observe, you will find that all positive things—hope, love, compassion, kindness—are just a lie, a simple layer of mask to hide the dark, brutal reality from us. That is why those who uncover those masks, who see the truth, can never truly become happy in their lives; they have seen the abyss, and it has stared back. There is a saying, a chilling truth: _"No tree can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell."_ And Fang Yuan's roots have been plunged into the deepest hell imaginable.

Seeing Fang Yuan's struggle, his collapse, and the horrifying condition of the river of flowers, everyone in the cave becomes utterly shocked, a collective gasp echoing through the space. And Fang Ma, even though her heart screams at her to run to him, to pull him out of the darkness, cannot move. She freezes on the spot, paralyzed by the horrifying scene unfolding before her, by the palpable sense of hopelessness that is rapidly spreading from the river of flowers, emanating from her son, threatening to engulf them all.

But suddenly, amidst the spreading darkness, something shifts in Fang Yuan's face. His hopeless, terrified, shocked expression begins to lose emotion, a chilling indifference spreading across his features. First, one of his eyes becomes completely emotionless, his gaze becoming cold and indifferent, fixed on nothing, empty. Then, the other eye follows, and gradually, his entire facial expression becomes blank, devoid of any feeling, a terrifying mask of emptiness. The violent shaking of his whole body, the trembling that wracked him moments before, starts to fade away, replaced by an unnerving stillness, a terrifying calm.

But before the whole process of emotional shutdown is complete, before the last flicker of feeling is extinguished, Fang Sianer rushes towards Fang Yuan, her small legs carrying her with surprising speed, her voice ringing out, filled with pure, unadulterated love and desperate concern. _"My love! My brother!"_ she cries out, tears already streaming down her face, her voice a lifeline thrown into the abyss.

Hearing her voice, that sound of pure, unconditional love, a beacon in the overwhelming darkness, the indifference in Fang Yuan's face begins to fade away rapidly, like a mask melting under intense heat. But then, terrifyingly, his one eye snaps back to complete indifference, his gaze cold and empty, not blinking, fixed on some unseen point. But his other eye looks terrified, filled with a raw, desperate fear, blinking rapidly, flickering between indifference and terror. His facial expression mirrors this internal battle, shifting rapidly between blank indifference and raw fear. It is as if someone, or something, is trying to take control over his body, a battle for his very soul being fought in his eyes, a horrifying internal conflict.

Suddenly, Fang Sianer reaches Fang Yuan and, without hesitation, embraces him, her small arms wrapping around him, her body a shield against the darkness, a source of warmth and light in the chilling water. She clings to him, crying, her voice filled with unwavering love. _"My love! You don't have to worry, brother! Talent doesn't matter! We are here! I am here!"_

In her embrace, at the overwhelming force of her pure love, the indifference in Fang Yuan's expression starts to fade away completely, pushed back by the powerful light of her soul.

Fang Ma, finally breaking free from her shock, her face a mask of despair and fierce, protective determination, has already rushed towards Fang Yuan. She reaches them, her heart aching at the sight of her son, kneeling in the dark water, looking utterly despaired and broken.

Suddenly, as Fang Ma reaches them, Fang Yuan’s face becomes completely expressionless, both eyes now blank and indifferent, the terrifying stillness returning. His hands, with a terrifying swiftness and strength that is not his own, violently grab Fang Sianer's neck and begin to crush it. His eyes are cold, indifferent, devoid of any emotion, but tears are flowing like streams down his face, a chilling, horrifying contrast between his actions and his body's response, a testament to the battle still raging within him.

But before any harm can come to Fang Sianer, before the darkness can claim him completely, Fang Ma embraces Fang Yuan from behind, her arms wrapping around him, pulling him and Fang Sianer close, her body a shield for both her children, a fortress of maternal love. She is crying, her voice raw with a mother's pain and fierce, desperate love. _"My son! My love! Don't lose your hope! Mama is here! We are here! I know you are facing a very difficult situation, something terrible is happening to you, but please, my love, please don't lose hope! You are not alone! Your mama and your little sister are with you! We will help you! We will pull you out of this darkness! We will fight with you!"_

In Fang Ma's embrace, at the sound of her voice filled with unconditional love, with the combined power of their desperate love surrounding him, the terrifying grip on Fang Sianer's neck loosens. The indifferent expression on Fang Yuan's face starts to vanish rapidly, melting away like ice under a warm sun, like a nightmare dissipating in the morning light. And then, the full force of the trauma, the horror of what he almost did, the terrifying glimpse into the abyss, washes over him. Fang Yuan's eyes fill with terror, tears flowing from them rapidly, a torrent of grief and guilt, as he looks at his hands, at the faint marks on Fang Sianer's neck.

Then, with a choked sob, a sound of raw agony and relief, he violently pulls Fang Sianer closer to him, embracing her very tightly, his arms wrapped around her as if she is the only thing anchoring him to reality, as if he is going to lose the very precious thing that is even more valuable than his life itself. He buries his face in her hair, crying violently, raw, guttural sobs that tear at his throat, releasing the pent-up agony of decades of suffering, of a past he never knew was his.

The scene is raw, emotional, and profoundly beautiful—a testament to the power of love in the face of unimaginable darkness, a moment that tears at the heartstrings. Fang Sianer is embracing Fang Yuan from the front, clinging to him, her tears mingling with his, her love a pure, unwavering light. Fang Yuan is holding her just as tightly, his body shaking with the force of his grief and relief, his arms a desperate embrace. And Fang Ma is embracing him from behind, her arms wrapped around both of them, pulling them into a circle of love and protection, a haven in the storm. They are all crying, their tears a shared expression of pain, fear, and unwavering, unconditional love.

Suddenly, the most beautiful, astonishing scene begins to unfold around them, a visual representation of hope fighting back against despair. As their tears fall, as their love radiates outwards, a powerful, shimmering light emanating from their combined embrace, the hope martial parasites begin to gain back their vitality. The flowers around them, which had turned dark and lifeless, start glowing again, their colors returning with renewed vibrancy, pushing back the encroaching blackness. The water, which had become black and still, also starts glowing with a soft, ethereal light. The rocks beneath them, which had lost their sparkle, begin to glow brightly once more. The bugs, which had fled in terror, now return, flying around them with bright, hopeful light. The fish, which had darted away, now swim around them, their scales glowing brightly in the revitalized water. It’s as if the entire River of Flowers has been reborn—not merely restored to its former glory, but elevated to a state of divine splendor, a testament to the power of the love and hope radiating from the three of them, a light pushing back the darkness.

But still, there is no light of hope around Fang Yuan himself. A small, dark spot remains beneath and around him, a lingering shadow of the abyss he just faced, a testament to the depth of his despair. However, the range of this darkness is very small now, contained, pushed back, by the overwhelming glow of hope emanating from both Fang Ma and Fang Sianer, a powerful light actively trying to extinguish the last vestiges of the darkness. The scene is truly beautiful and spectacular, a visual representation of the battle between despair and hope, between the darkness of the past and the light of the present. All the hope martial parasites are circling Fang Sianer and Fang Ma, their light a brilliant halo around them, while sharply avoiding the small, dark area around Fang Yuan. The scene is astonishing because it looks like a tiny dark dot, a remnant of the abyss, caught between two massive, radiant circles of bright, pure light, a powerful symbol of love pulling a soul back from the brink, a beacon in the darkness.
