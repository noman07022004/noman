Fang Yuan finds himself submerged in the memory, thrown back into the heart of a chaotic, brutal battlefield. The air screams with the clash of steel and fur, the growls of beasts mingling with the cries of dying men. Thousands of lightning wolves, their eyes glowing with savage intent, surge against the village defenses, a living tide of destruction. Clan members fight desperately, throwing their lives away to protect their home, striking at the wolves, pushing back against the relentless assault. But he, the Fang Yuan of this memory, is not fighting. He is hiding in a dark corner, concealed by the shadows of the night, observing the unfolding massacre with cold, detached eyes. He sees countless clan members fall, their bodies torn apart by the wolves, their desperate struggles ending in pools of blood. He could have saved many of them, even without risking his own life, a simple intervention would have been enough, but he doesn't care. **He watches them die.**

His gaze is fixed not on the main battle lines, but on a young girl positioned at a safe distance behind the defenses. This girl is helping the injured, her hands busy tending to wounds, surrounded by others who are protecting her, a fragile sanctuary in the midst of hell. This girl is Yao Le. She works with focused intensity, treating the wounded, her youth a stark contrast to the grim reality around her. She is at a seemingly secure distance, a vital hub in the clan's desperate struggle for survival.

Fang Yuan’s cold eyes then sweep over the martial masters who have created a three-layered defense system. The first layer, a wall of flesh and steel, is made up of martial masters skilled in using defensive martial artifacts and parasites. They form a strong barrier, a shield meant to absorb the force of the lightning wolf tide, to prevent it from breaking through. The second layer is composed of those skilled in offensive martial artifacts and parasites, positioned behind the first, striking at the wolves that get close, a relentless wave of attacks. The third layer consists of watch towers, tall structures manned by multiple martial masters whose work is to gather information, observe the battlefield, and use their long-range attacks to protect those in danger below. And after all these three layers, at the very rear, is the medical station, a place of healing led by the young girl, Yao Le. She is treating the injured, her skill exceptional; she is a highly talented martial master in the healing path, already chosen as the successor of the medicine hall.

Fang Yuan observes the defense layers meticulously, his mind making cold calculations. He notes the position of each group, their strengths and weaknesses. His gaze lingers on the medical camp, on Yao Le, calculating her location, her vulnerability. After doing some quick calculations, his eyes glittering with a cold, strategic light, he takes his position, hidden in the shadows, and launches his attack. His target: the watch towers. Before anyone on the towers can understand what is happening, before they can even react, Fang Yuan’s attack, silent and devastating, strikes their vital points. They die instantly, their bodies slumping to the ground atop the towers, their role in the defense abruptly ended.

Then, with swift, calculated movements, Fang Yuan changes his position, melting deeper into the shadows. He targets the first layer of defense, the martial masters focused solely on holding the line against the relentless wolf tide. He attacks three defensive martial masters from behind, their backs exposed as they strain against the wolf tide. They die on the spot, their bodies collapsing, their defenses dissolving. They were so heavily concentrated on the lightning wolves in front of them, they never saw the devastating attack, the fatal strike, that came from within their own ranks.

Panic erupts in the first layer, the defense faltering. The offensive martial masters in the second layer respond instantly, going all out, their attacks becoming more desperate, trying to compensate for the breach. Fang Yuan, seamlessly blending in with the chaos, pretends to go all out with them, his attacks fierce, yet carefully aimed to avoid hitting any wolves. He shouts, his voice carrying over the din of battle, a false urgency in his tone, _"Where is the reinforcement? Our watch towers are down!"_

An offensive martial master, his face grim with the strain of battle, shouts back, _"There is no one on our watch towers! We need help!"_

Fang Yuan, seizing the moment, shouts, _"I am going to bring the reinforcement!"_ Saying so, he quickly turns and runs away from the main battle line before anyone can respond, before anyone can question his actions. After putting some distance between himself and the desperate fighters, he stops, his eyes cold and calculating. He targets the remaining offensive martial masters, those desperately attacking the lightning wolves, their backs still exposed, vulnerable. He attacks them, his strikes coming from behind, silent and devastating, injuring their fatal points. They all die, their bodies falling amongst the charging wolves. Even those few who survived his initial attack are instantly killed and devoured by the lightning wolves, their screams lost in the chaos.

Casualties begin to escalate rapidly as the lightning wolves, finding no resistance, surge through the broken defense line. The battlefield descends into utter chaos, the organized defense crumbling into a desperate, every-man-for-himself struggle. But Fang Yuan, the Fang Yuan of this memory, watches from a safe distance, a chilling detachment in his eyes. He manipulates the lightning wolf tide, a predator guiding his pack. He subtly attacks a martial master here, a few lightning wolves there, carefully guiding the flow of the tide, directing their ravenous hunger towards a single target: the medical camp.

Thanks to Fang Yuan’s cold, calculated manipulation, the lightning wolf tide, a force of nature unleashed, reaches the medical camp. The wolves, their eyes burning with a savage hunger, surge into the fragile sanctuary, attacking the injured and the medical staff with brutal efficiency.

Yao Le, just a moment before a dedicated healer tending to wounds, is now facing a life-threatening situation. Her heart freezes in her chest as she witnesses the brutal efficiency of the attack, as she sees her guards dying before her eyes, their bodies torn apart by the wolves. She is just a teenager, barely seventeen, and she has never seen death this close, this brutal. Her eyes and face are wide open, not with determination, but with pure, unadulterated fear and terror. The sanctuary of healing has become a slaughterhouse, and she is caught in the middle, helpless.
