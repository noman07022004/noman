Another month has passed in a whirlwind of joyful anticipation. Today marks the grand welcoming ceremony for Fang Yuan, Fang Zheng, and Fang Sianer. The entire Fang clan is abuzz with activity. Even in the village market outside the clan's walls, decorations adorn every corner, creating an atmosphere of celebration as if welcoming the arrival of future rulers.

Whispers drift amongst the villagers as they arrive to partake in the feast. _"I heard it's the welcoming ceremony for a powerful elder's three newborn children: Young Master Fang Yuan, Young Master Fang Zheng, and Young Lady Fang Sianer,"_ one villager murmurs.

_"They say this will continue for seven days!"_ another exclaims in awe.

_"And they'll be serving us the expensive dishes that even Gu Masters eat,"_ a third adds, his eyes wide with amazement. This is an unprecedented occasion for the villagers, a level of respect and generosity they have never experienced before. In the past, they felt no more significant than ants to the esteemed Fang clan.

Within Fang Yuan's grand mansion, the scene is even more breathtaking. The decorations create a heavenly ambiance. Fang Ma, Fang Fu, Fang Yuan, Fang Zheng, and Fang Sianer are all dressed in exquisite attire. Fang Ma looks like a celestial being, cradling an angel in her arms. No one can take their eyes off their radiant presence. Fang Fu exudes the aura of a heroic figure, with young Fang Zheng nestled securely in his hands, adding to his majestic appearance. Fang Yuan, a picture of a cute little tyrant, exudes a captivating charm. Anyone witnessing this family would surely feel a pang of envy.

They are now seated in the grand hall, upon an elevated platform that serves as the main seat. This vantage point allows all the guests to see them clearly. The guests themselves are seated at round tables arranged before the platform, each table accommodating three to five chairs. This arrangement allows them to easily view Fang Fu's family while comfortably conversing and enjoying the delectable food and drinks placed on the tables before them. Servants move gracefully among the tables, serving an array of delicious and expensive dishes.

The welcoming ceremony is about to commence. The guests are now seated in their designated places, the most important figures occupying the front rows. As the ceremony unfolds, they will approach the main seat one by one to present their gifts.

In the first row sit the clan leader and the esteemed elders, accompanied by their family members. At the end of this row, Gu Yue Dong Tu and his wife, Gu Yue Dong Mi, are seated. They wear smiles, but their eyes betray a forced happiness that doesn't quite reach their gaze. Gu Yue Dong Tu is Fang Fu's older brother. From a young age, he had been the center of attention, a position he held until Fang Fu's birth. Though talented, Dong Tu always found himself overshadowed by his younger brother. Girls were invariably drawn to Fang Fu's charm. In any gathering, people naturally gravitated towards Fang Fu, treating him as the de facto leader. Dong Tu had begun his cultivation journey early, excelling among his peers, yet Fang Fu, despite starting later, quickly surpassed him, even demonstrating remarkable fighting prowess, capable of defeating opponents of a higher rank.

Another devastating blow came when Fang Fu returned to the clan with a breathtakingly beautiful woman â€“ Fang Ma. She was not only stunning but also a rare healing Gu Master. Dong Tu had married his wife primarily for her beauty, a decision that secretly fueled his jealousy, thinking, _"Look at my beautiful wife, while you have none!"_ Even though Dong Mi lacked talent in cultivation, his supposed unwavering love for her was a source of twisted satisfaction. When Dong Tu would inquire about Fang Fu's marital plans, the younger brother would simply reply that he would marry if it was heaven's will. This response would elicit a bitter laugh from Dong Tu, who knew how difficult it was to find a beautiful and loving wife. But now, seeing Fang Ma by Fang Fu's side, declared as his wife, Dong Tu's resentment festered. Learning that Fang Fu had rescued Fang Ma in a manner reminiscent of a fairy tale only intensified his hatred.

Fate seemed particularly cruel to Dong Tu and Dong Mi. They had been trying diligently for years to conceive a child, but without success. When they first heard of Fang Ma giving birth to Fang Yuan, an intense wave of anger, hatred, and jealousy washed over them. They doubled their efforts, sometimes forgoing sleep in their desperate desire for a child, but to no avail. Then, just six months later, news arrived of Fang Ma's second child, a blow that felt like a cruel twist of fate, as if the heavens were rewarding Fang Fu's efforts while mocking their own. They consulted doctors, who found no physical impediments but suggested it might be difficult and prescribed remedies to enhance their chances, urging them to work even harder. The next six months were filled with exhausting attempts, yet still no pregnancy. Then, the news of Fang Ma's third child reached them, pushing their despair beyond comprehension. Despite this bitter history, Dong Tu had approached Fang Fu, feigning curiosity about their secret to conceiving children so quickly, a feat he considered heaven-defying. Fang Fu had simply responded that it was a gift from heaven, something he hadn't expected but was incredibly grateful for. This innocent reply, coupled with Fang Fu's genuine happiness, only worsened Dong Tu's feelings towards his younger brother. He, the elder, was seemingly overlooked by destiny, while everything was bestowed upon Fang Fu as if the heavens themselves favored the younger sibling. And now, in the first row, he and his wife sat, forced to witness the laughter and happiness of Fang Fu's family, their gazes dark as they observed Fang Fu's radiant smile and the joy of his loved ones.

At a slight distance, Clan Leader Gu Yue Bo sat, his expression serene, seemingly bestowing a gentle blessing upon Fang Fu's family. However, as his gaze flickered towards Dong Tu's dark countenance, a calculated smile played on his lips. He sensed an opportunity to eliminate a potential threat to his leadership. Gu Yue Bo, a Rank 4 middle-stage Gu Master, had achieved his current cultivation level after the age of fifty. His position as clan leader was generally secure, but whispers had reached his ears suggesting that Fang Fu, a Rank 3 peak-stage Gu Master, might be capable of defeating him. This possibility gnawed at his confidence. He rose from his seat and made his way towards Dong Tu and Dong Mi, greeting them with a polite nod and initiating a seemingly casual conversation.
