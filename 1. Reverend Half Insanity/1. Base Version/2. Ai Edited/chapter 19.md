Three years pass in the blink of an eye. Fang Yuan is now seven, Fang Zheng is a lively six and a half, growing just like any normal child, and at last, after all these years, Fang Sianer, now six, is finally able to engage in simple conversation.

During these years, nothing slipped past Fang Ma’s control. However, one relationship has deteriorated as expected—her feud with Dong Wi, the wife of Dong Tu.

The reason is obvious. Dong Tu is relentlessly trying to win Fang Ma’s favor, ignoring Dong Wi in the process. Dong Wi has always resented Fang Ma for having everything she ever wanted, despite all her efforts to claim even a fraction of it.

And now, just a few days ago, Dong Tu managed to convince Fang Ma to dine with them at the same table along with her children. Dong Wi still remembers the sheer joy and excitement on Dong Tu’s face that day—it was as if he had conquered the world.

But that wasn’t enough. Dong Tu showered Fang Ma with exaggerated displays of kindness and gentleness, even in Dong Wi’s presence.

Dong Wi had despised Fang Ma from the very beginning. Despite her hard work, she had received nothing, while Fang Ma seemed to have everything effortlessly. When she first heard of Fang Ma’s death, she thought justice had finally been served. But once again, she was proven wrong—Fang Ma miraculously returned.

Still, Dong Wi found some satisfaction in knowing that Fang Ma had lost her husband. She assumed that, as the new mistress of the grand mansion, she would wield control. The servants feared her. She believed she had become the queen, and from now on, Fang Ma would be at her mercy.

But reality had different plans. Not only had her husband become Fang Ma’s blind, obedient dog, but she herself had been reduced to nothing more than Fang Ma’s servant.

Dong Wi was the one who managed the mansion, giving orders to the servants, maintaining order. And Fang Ma? She did nothing but care for her children, spending her time playing with them, going out, and enjoying life.

Her children ran wild, leaving the mansion in disarray, and it was Dong Wi who had to clean up the mess, barking orders at the servants. Worse still, if Dong Tu noticed anything out of place, he would scold Dong Wi harshly.

She spent hours in the kitchen preparing elaborate meals for herself and her husband, only for Dong Tu to take the food and give it to Fang Ma and her children. And when she dared to protest, he scolded her even more fiercely—sometimes even resorting to slaps for failing to follow his instructions.

Dong Wi had no power, no backing. Before marrying Dong Tu, she was just a simple village girl. Dong Tu had fallen in love with her at first sight, married her, and cherished her ever since. But now, she feared that if she defied him, he might cast her aside.

Her woman instinct had warned her before—Fang Ma wasn’t the helpless woman she pretended to be. No, she was a venomous snake. Dong Wi has even attempted to subtly undermine Fang Ma, but each attempt has backfired spectacularly, resulting in Dong Tu's furious reprimands. Even without evidence, her woman intuition told her Fang Ma is the one pulling the strings from behind the scenes.

She has tried again and again to fight back, but every attempt failed. Her relationship with her husband crumbled. Now, she has no choice but to become an obedient servant to Fang Ma. Her strength has been stripped away. Her husband has become Fang Ma’s blind, loyal dog. And she has nowhere left to turn.
