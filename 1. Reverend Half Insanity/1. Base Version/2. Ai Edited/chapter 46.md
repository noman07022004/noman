They move towards the bed, their steps quiet, determined. They kneel on either side of Fang Yuan, their faces now solemn, reflecting the gravity of the task they are about to undertake, the risk they are willing to embrace for his sake. Suddenly, a flicker of doubt crosses Fang Sianer's face, and she whispers, her voice barely audible, **_"Will there be any problem if we both inject our martial essence at the same time into him?"_**

Yao Le thinks for a moment, recalling the lessons, the elders' warnings. **_"I think there won't be any problem,"_** she says, her voice gaining confidence, **_"especially since I've been checked by multiple elders through their martial essence. My core is... accustomed to external essence, even if polluted. And we are the same rank."_**

Fang Sianer nods, but the worry lingers in her eyes. **_"I hope so,"_** she says softly, **_"but you should be very careful. You can recall how the clan leader's condition became after he just injected his martial essence into My love."_** The memory of the elder's terrified face, his immediate recoil, is still vivid.

Yao Le’s expression hardens, the fear momentarily replaced by a grim determination. **_"Yes,"_** she says, her voice low, **_"I can still recall how fearful he looked. And afterward, another elder also checked, but his condition was the same. So no other elders dared to check brother Fang Yuan again. And Aunt Fang Ma… she has been checking brother for a long time now, days and nights, and every time, she jumps backward with a fearful expression, panting, trembling. So, yes, we should be careful. Are you… are you still sure you want to inject your martial essence, Sianer? Knowing how dangerous it is?"_**

Fang Sianer's gaze is unwavering, fixed on Fang Yuan's still face. **_"Of course, I still want to,"_** she responds, her voice filled with an absolute certainty that overrides any fear. **_"Even though I am a bit fearful… I will do it. For my love."_**

Yao Le takes a deep breath, mirroring Fang Sianer's resolve. **_"I also want to,"_** she says, her voice firm. **_"Even though I am a bit fearful, I will do it. For brother Fang Yuan."_**

They each hold one of Fang Yuan's hands tightly, intertwining their fingers, a physical connection solidifying their shared purpose. They close their eyes, taking deep, centering breaths, focusing their minds, gathering their martial essence within their cores. After a few breaths, guided by their will, their martial essence, pure and vibrant, enters Fang Yuan's body through their joined hands.

As their essence flows into him, a sense of profound satisfaction washes over both Yao Le and Fang Sianer. They have successfully injected their martial essence without any immediate accident, without any terrifying recoil like Fang Ma's. Their initial worry fades, replaced by a sense of accomplishment, a quiet hope.

They begin to move their martial essence, threads of light guided by their will, towards his heart, towards the core of the mystery, the source of the darkness. As they get close to Fang Yuan's heart, as their essence nears the terrifying black core, they start feeling uncomfortable, a chilling coldness seeping into their own essence. A cold sweat starts pouring out of Yao Le's face, her body tensing with unease, but Fang Sianer looks remarkably well, her expression still one of intense concentration, showing less physical distress.

After sometime, as Yao Le's martial essence touches the very surface of Fang Yuan's martial core, a wave of pure, unadulterated terror washes over her. She feels it – the terrifying sensation of being devoured alive, an immense, soul-crushing pain. With a gasp, she recoils violently, jumping backward, breaking the connection, fearful and panting heavily, her face a mask of horror.

A few breaths later, her heart still pounding, she manages to check Fang Sianer's condition. She looks, stunned, to see that Fang Sianer is still kneeling by the bed, her condition seemingly well, nothing much has happened. Moments pass by, stretching into an eternity, but Fang Sianer is still holding Fang Yuan's hand with both of hers, her eyes closed in concentration, still injecting her martial essence into Fang Yuan's body, and then, incredibly, into his martial core.

Yao Le, despite the horrifying experience, the pain and terror she just faced, remains determined. Even though her condition has become worse, her body trembling, she still looks resolute. It is as if she is ready to sacrifice herself again and again, if it means helping Fang Yuan.

Then, she looks at Fang Sianer for a few breaths, watching her, her heart filled with a mixture of fear and admiration as Fang Sianer continues the terrifying process. With a sudden decision, she moves behind Fang Sianer, her movements quiet and deliberate. She places both of her hands on the back of Fang Sianer's neck, focusing her will, and begins to inject her martial essence into Fang Sianer's martial core through her body, using Fang Sianer as a conduit.

As her martial essence passes through the transparent wall of Fang Sianer's martial core, it undergoes a transformation. It becomes green, taking on the color and, somehow, the properties of Fang Sianer's unique essence. She feels that she is losing all direct control over her martial essence that has entered into Fang Sianer's martial core; it is no longer solely hers, but something else, something intertwined with Sianer's essence. But regardless, she continues to inject her martial essence into Fang Sianer's core, trusting in Sianer, trusting in this process.

After sometime, she notices something astonishing. Even though she has lost direct control over her martial essence, she can still observe what it is doing, where it is going, guided by Fang Sianer's will. Then, she observes that her martial essence, which has turned green, is also being injected into Fang Yuan's body, flowing towards his heart, and then, into his martial core.

But as this time she enters into Fang Yuan's martial core, she doesn't feel that terrifying, consuming fear, not with the same intensity. Even though she feels that those martial essences, both hers and Fang Sianer's, are also being devoured by Fang Yuan's martial core, the horrifying void is… different. She doesn't feel the same terror, the same soul-crushing dread. Instead, she feels that something within this green martial essence, this combined essence flowing through Fang Sianer, is protecting their will, their consciousness, shielding it from the abyss. And she feels that their will, their consciousness, is safely being allowed to retreat, to pull back from the edge of the black core.

Suddenly, the door bursts open, and Fang Ma enters the room, her face pale, her eyes wide with alarm. She becomes instantly terrified as she sees the scene before her – Fang Sianer kneeling beside Fang Yuan, injecting martial essence into his body, while Yao Le is behind Fang Sianer, injecting her essence into Fang Sianer's body. She quickly rushes forward, her voice filled with a mother's desperate fear. **_"NO!"_** she shouts, her hand outstretched as if to stop them.

But at that moment, Fang Sianer and Yao Le both open their eyes. They are panting heavily, their bodies exhausted, but a look of profound satisfaction, a quiet triumph, can be seen in their eyes. They have done it.

Fang Ma reaches Fang Sianer, her hands desperately checking her, her voice filled with a mother's raw fear. **_"Are you alright?! My love, are you alright?! What were you doing?!"_**

Fang Sianer responds, her voice weak but steady, a soft smile on her face. **_"Yes, Mama, I am completely fine. We... we think we helped him."_**

Then Fang Ma looks at Yao Le, her gaze shifting, her worry encompassing both girls. She quickly checks her, her hands trembling slightly, and asks, **_"Are you alright, Yao Le?! You look worse than Fang Sianer. What happened?!"_**

Yao Le responds, her voice weak, her body swaying slightly, but a triumphant smile on her face. **_"I… I am alright, Aunt Fang Ma, I just…_"** Before she can finish her sentence, her eyes flutter closed, and she faints on the spot, collapsing onto the floor, her body finally succumbing to the strain and the shock of the terrifying encounter with the black core, even through the protective layer of Fang Sianer's essence.
