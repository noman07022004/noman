Another month has passed quickly, a testament to the relentless passage of time and the unyielding efforts of Fang Ma and her devoted children. During this month, Fang Yuan has attended the academy regularly, a fragile return to normalcy. Outwardly, he appears like any other child, but his eyes, haunted by the horrors he has glimpsed, betray the deep emotional scars he carries.

It is afternoon, and the courtyard of their mansion is alive with the gentle sounds of play. Fang Yuan, Fang Zheng, Fang Sianer, and Shen Cui are engaged in a game, their laughter a soft melody. Fang Ma observes them, her gaze tender, offering guidance when needed. Fang Zheng and Shen Cui are often engrossed in their own world, their growing affection an open secret that Fang Ma observes with a knowing smile. Yao Le and Fang Sianer, however, remain closely engaged with Fang Yuan, their attention unwavering.

Fang Sianer looks up, a question in her eyes. **"Will Sister Yao Le not come today?"** she asks. **"After Brother started going to the academy, you sent Yao Le back to her home, even though she didn't want to leave."**

Fang Ma smiles gently. **"Yao Le's parents have arrived, my dear. She should spend time with them. Besides, you all play at the academy together every day, and Yao Le comes here every afternoon to play with you."**

**"But she hasn't come today?"** Fang Sianer presses, a hint of disappointment in her voice.

**"Her parents might want to spend more time with her,"** Fang Ma explains, **"as I've heard they will soon be leaving the village for a while."**

**"Will Yao Le leave with them?"** Fang Sianer asks, her voice tinged with worry.

**"Probably not,"** Fang Ma replies. **"They are going for business. So, Yao Le will stay here in the village."**

**"Then Yao Le will play with us again, right?"** Fang Sianer asks, her face brightening.

Fang Ma chuckles softly. **"Who knows? Maybe she will again start living at our house with you, since you all have become such good friends."**

Fang Sianer beams. **"Actually, she told me that after her parents leave, she will again live with me! He he he!"**

Fang Ma's gaze then shifts to Fang Yuan, who is quietly drawing. His face, though calmer than before, still carries a profound sorrow. **"My love, Fang Yuan,"** she says softly, her voice filled with concern, **"is there anything bothering you? You don't look well. Please tell Mama."**

Fang Sianer, ever attuned to her brother, adds, **"My love, is there any problem? Or are you unhappy because Yao Le isn't here?"**

Fang Yuan continues to draw, his hand still trembling slightly. After a moment, he finishes his drawing and slowly hands the picture to Fang Ma. Fang Ma takes a look, her face softening with a gentle smile. It’s the same picture from before, the simple, heartfelt depiction of their family. **"I know, my love,"** she says, her voice filled with tenderness. **"You really love me. I love you too."** She embraces him, pulling him into a warm hug.

**"Let me see it!"** Fang Sianer demands, her curiosity piqued. Fang Zheng and Shen Cui also gather around to see the drawing.

Fang Zheng points to the figures. **"The middle one is Mama, and this is Fang Sianer, and beside her is Yao Le, isn't it?"**

**"Yes! It's me!"** Fang Sianer confirms excitedly.

Fang Zheng points to another figure. **"And this must be Brother Fang Yuan, isn't it?"**

Fang Yuan’s voice is low, barely a whisper, as he corrects him. **"No… it is you."**

Fang Zheng’s eyes widen in amazement. **"Really? Is it me? Then this… this is you, Shen Cui!"**

**"Is it really me?"** Shen Cui asks, her voice filled with surprise and delight.

Fang Yuan nods, his voice still low. **"Yes."**

Shen Cui notices something at the bottom of the drawing. **"Look, there's something written here!"**

Fang Zheng reads it aloud. **"It says, 'I love you all.' That means Brother Fang Yuan loves us all, am I correct?"**

Fang Yuan hesitates, his mouth opening and closing, trying to articulate a "yes," but no sound emerges. A few moments later, Fang Ma, seeing his silent struggle, his eyes welling up with unshed tears, pulls him closer. **"My love, are you worried about anything? I know it might be hard, but don't worry. Mama is always here."** Fang Yuan suddenly jumps into her embrace, burying his face in her shoulder, and begins to cry silently, his body shaking. Fang Ma holds him tightly, murmuring, **"Don't worry. I am here. Mama is here."** Fang Sianer, Fang Zheng, and Shen Cui look on with worried expressions. Fang Yuan hasn't cried like this for weeks, and they have grown accustomed to his pale, subdued face. They cannot fully comprehend the depth of his pain. Only Fang Ma, ever vigilant, knows that something is still deeply wrong with Fang Yuan and tirelessly works to comfort, heal, and bring him back.

After a while, Fang Yuan looks at Fang Sianer, his eyes still filled with a profound sorrow, and without a word, he hugs her. Later, Fang Yuan sits leaning against Fang Ma, watching Fang Sianer, Fang Zheng, and Shen Cui playing a game of tag in the courtyard. Fang Sianer is running, chasing Fang Zheng and Shen Cui, trying to tag them.

Breaking the comfortable silence, Fang Yuan speaks, his voice still soft and a little shaky. **"Mama, I want to go outside to buy something."**

Fang Ma’s eyes light up, a gentle smile gracing her lips. **"Okay, my love! Let's go. I will help you buy anything you want."**

Fang Yuan hesitates, then says, **"I want to buy it by myself… alone. It might take some time, because I want to buy things for everyone."**

Fang Ma gives a gentle laugh, her heart swelling with warmth. **"Is my love planning to buy presents and surprise all of us?"**

Fang Yuan hesitates for a moment, then a faint, almost imperceptible smile touches his lips. **"Yes."**

Fang Ma hugs him tightly and presses a kiss to his forehead. **"Okay, my clever boy. Let's quietly move out so they don't notice. What do you say?"**

Fang Yuan nods slowly. **"Okay."**

Afterward, Fang Yuan and Fang Ma quietly slip back into the mansion. Fang Yuan turns to his mother. **"Mama, I am going to change my dress in my room. Afterward, I am coming to your room."**

Fang Ma smiles gently. **"Okay, my love. I am waiting."**

After some time, Fang Yuan comes to Fang Ma's room, dressed in simple, unassuming clothes. **"Mama,"** he says, **"I am ready. I am leaving."**

Fang Ma observes his attire – a plain black dress and a hood that will help him hide his face. **"Oh, how could I forget?"** she muses aloud. **"If you go outside, everyone will crowd around you, won't they? That might make it difficult to buy things."** Fang Yuan nods hesitantly. **"Yes."**

Fang Ma’s smile brightens, a new idea sparking in her eyes. **"My love, I have an even better solution!"** Afterward, Fang Ma brings out a martial artifact, a small, intricate device, and hands it to Fang Yuan. **"Insert your will into it and try to use it. You will see the magic."** As Fang Yuan activates the artifact, his face completely changes, transforming into a different appearance. Fang Ma holds a mirror before him. **"Look,"** she says, her voice filled with excitement. **"You look completely different now!"** Fang Yuan looks at his reflection, a hesitant **"Thank you"** escaping his lips.

Afterward, Fang Ma gives him a small pouch, filled with many more artifacts, martial elixirs, and a large number of martial stones. Fang Yuan looks at the overflowing pouch, his eyes wide. **"Mama,"** he says, his voice soft, **"I already have many. I don't need this much. You've given me so many, I haven't even counted them all."** Fang Ma, however, insists, her love overflowing.

As he prepares to leave, Fang Yuan turns to his mother. **"Mama, I am leaving. Promise me you will not follow me, okay? Or send any servant to follow me."** Fang Ma’s heart skips a beat. She had been planning to secretly follow him, and at least send a dozen servants to watch over him. She hesitates, caught between her promise and her overwhelming worry. Before Fang Ma can answer, Fang Yuan hugs her tightly again, burying his face in her shoulder, and says, his voice thick with sobs, **"M-mama… I l-love y-you."** Fang Ma hugs him back fiercely. **"I love you too, my love."**

After a moment, Fang Yuan pulls back. **"Mama, I am leaving now."** Fang Ma feels a pang of hesitation, but her promise, and the desire to foster his independence, win out. **"Okay, my love,"** she says, her voice gentle. **"But don't make Mama wait too long, or Mama will worry."** Fang Yuan nods hesitantly, a lingering sob in his voice. **"Mama, don't worry about me. I love you."** Fang Ma repeats, **"I love you too."**

Then, Fang Yuan slips out of the mansion through the back gate. Fang Ma watches him go, standing at the gate with several servants beside her. She feels a profound unease, but she wants to keep her promise. A guard steps forward. **"Mistress, wouldn't it be better if we followed Young Master in secret? If there's any problem…"** Other servants add their pleas. **"Yes, I think at least one of us should follow Young Master Fang Yuan."**

Fang Ma sighs, her worry evident. **"You are right, and my heart also doesn't want to let him go alone. But I hope nothing bad will happen. It is our clan, our village, and everyone loves Fang Yuan. I know there might be some enemies who might think of doing him harm, but I believe they will not be able to, because it is our clan and our village, and no one would dare to do anything to my love within this clan's boundaries. And my love is going to the market to buy presents for us, and the market is the busiest place, so there would be no problem."**

A servant bows. **"Mistress, please forgive us for doubting your decision."** Fang Ma shakes her head. **"You don't have to apologize. I also want to send at least one of you, but I have made a promise to him."**

At that moment, Fang Sianer appears from behind them. **"Mama, where is Brother going?"** Fang Ma turns, a gentle smile on her face. **"Your brother is going to buy some gifts for us."** Fang Sianer’s eyes light up. **"I'm going after him!"**

**"No,"** Fang Ma says, her voice firm.

**"Please, Mama, please! Let me go!"** Fang Sianer pleads. Fang Ma, still worried and wanting to send someone to look after Fang Yuan, ponders. _'I promised him not to send any servant, and I myself will not follow him. But I haven't mentioned that I can't send Fang Sianer, his sister. I know it might be exploiting a loophole, but my heart will not be at ease if I don't send someone to look after Fang Yuan.'_

And so, Fang Ma relents. **"You can go,"** she says, handing Fang Sianer a small martial artifact. **"But you have to only see him from a distance, and you also have to use this martial artifact to hide your identity. Do you understand?"**

**"Okay, I will!"** Fang Sianer agrees eagerly. She activates the artifact, and her face instantly changes, transforming into a different appearance. Fang Ma reminds her, **"Your brother is wearing a black dress and his face is also different. Remember that."** Then, Fang Ma points towards Fang Yuan, who is walking quickly away. **"This is your brother, wearing the black dress and black hat."**

Fang Sianer smiles, her eyes filled with confidence. **"Don't worry, Mama. I can feel my love from a long distance, and even from here, I can sense him. So don't worry. I will find him."** And then, Fang Sianer, her identity concealed, rushes after Fang Yuan, maintaining a careful distance, a silent guardian in the bustling village.
