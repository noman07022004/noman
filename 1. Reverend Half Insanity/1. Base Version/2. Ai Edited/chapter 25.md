Days pass by quickly, slipping through the fingers of time. It is now the night before the awakening ceremony.

A light rain falls outside, whispering against the windowpanes, making the environment feel cold and hushed. Fang Ma and Fang Sianer are sleeping in their room, nestled together against the chill. In their own room, Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng sleep soundly. Fang Ma, ever disciplined, has cultivated the habit of going to bed early and waking early.

In Fang Ma's room, Fang Sianer sleeps peacefully on Fang Ma's arm, her small body a comforting weight. Fang Ma, however, is wide awake, her gaze fixed on the full moon hanging like a pale lantern in the night sky. Worry lines are visible around her eyes.

_"Why am I feeling so anxious?"_ she ponders inwardly, her thoughts a restless tide. _"I have taken every measure possible, double-checked everything, and there is no apparent error at all. I have given Fang Yuan so much love, ensured he is surrounded by kindness, and now everyone loves him. I have worked so hard to prevent him from becoming the notorious, ruthless villain he was in the novel. I can still remember how I forced myself to read parts of that story, despite the terrible deeds Fang Yuan committed. The segment with the bear and the girl… that was too much; I had to drop it there and then. I don't have any proper memories of most events, and I hardly remember even the names of other characters, let alone specific plot points. So, I don't know who that girl was or what happened to her, but I believe now, in this life, that girl will not face such a cruel consequence."_

She looks down at Fang Sianer, a wave of relief washing over her. _"I am really happy that I have such a beautiful daughter,"_ she thinks, her heart swelling with love. _"And my sons… they are also so cute. I feel I have raised all of them quite well. They are all pure souls with pure hearts, especially Fang Yuan."_

Yet, the anxiety persists. _"I am still feeling worried,"_ she admits to herself. _"Tomorrow, Fang Yuan will likely awaken a low talent, but that won't be a problem. I've spent years sowing the seed of determination in his heart, emphasizing that hard work and effort are more important than innate talent. But still, I feel like I am missing something, something very important, a crucial piece of the puzzle."_

Her worry grows, a nagging feeling she cannot shake. _"No, I can't take this anymore,"_ she decides, pushing the blankets aside. _"I have to check on Fang Yuan. And how about I give him another goodnight kiss? Maybe even steal one for myself… He he he. Who is that notorious villain, anyway? He is just my cute little son, Fang Yuan."_

She quietly slips out of the room and makes her way to Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng's room.

In Fang Yuan's room, a soft moonlight filters through the window. Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng are sleeping soundly in their separate beds. It is evident that they don't fight like normal siblings. Fang Zheng seems to follow Fang Yuan's lead and doesn't question his decisions; they have simply grown up that way, a quiet understanding between them.

Suddenly, without warning, Fang Yuan's whole body begins to tremble violently, a tremor that shakes the very bed he lies on. All the fine hairs on his skin stand up like soldiers sensing an unseen, terrifying threat. His fists clench so tightly that his knuckles turn bone-white, the veins on his forearms bulging with tension. His heart pounds like a frantic war drum in his chest, the sound loud enough that it seems to echo in the sudden, heavy silence of the room.

In mere moments, his body is drenched in sweat – sweat pouring off him as if he'd been caught in a sudden, torrential downpour, or had just emerged from a scalding bath. The moisture clings to his skin like a second layer, shimmering in the dim light, accentuating the sheer intensity of the torment he is experiencing.

His breath is shallow, ragged, coming in gasps, as if he's been running for his life, pursued by an invisible predator. His eyes – though closed – twitch restlessly beneath their lids, his eyeballs darting back and forth as though locked in a desperate struggle within a nightmare no one else can see, a battle being fought deep within his mind.

At that moment, Fang Ma enters the room – and the sight before her makes her heart seize in her chest, the blood draining from her face.

_"Fang Yuan…!"_

Her voice is barely a whisper, caught between shock and terror. Her eyes widen, fixed on her son. He is trembling violently, his body soaked in sweat, his small fists clenched so tightly they look like they might never open again. The sound of his labored breathing, the look of sheer torment etched across his face, even in sleep – it's too much to bear. For one terrifying heartbeat, she forgets how to move, how to breathe, frozen by the horrifying spectacle.

Then instinct takes over.

She rushes to his side, dropping to her knees beside the bed, her hands trembling as she reaches for him. _"My love, wake up – wake up, it's just a dream!"_ she pleads, her voice laced with desperation, brushing the sweat-drenched hair from his forehead. Her palm cups his cheek gently, trying to ground him, to pull him back from whatever nightmare has claimed him, to anchor him to the safety of the waking world.

_"Shh… Mama’s here. It’s okay. You’re safe now,"_ she murmurs, her voice quivering, soothing, trying to pour all her love, all her strength, into those simple words.

She cradles his head against her chest, rocking him slightly, as if he were still a small boy seeking comfort. Tears prick at the corners of her eyes – helpless, desperate tears, a mother’s tears, born of a fear so profound it threatens to consume her.

She doesn’t know what is happening inside his mind, what horror he is facing, but she knows this much with absolute certainty: she’ll stay right here, holding him, her arms a shield, until he wakes up – and even then, she won’t let go.

But Fang Yuan doesn't wake up. He remains trapped in the clutches of whatever terror holds him captive. Despite Fang Ma's desperate whispering, her soft touches, her gentle shaking of his shoulders, he remains unresponsive. His whole body still trembles uncontrollably, a constant vibration of fear. Sweat continues to pour from his skin like a fevered storm, soaking the sheets, and his chest rises and falls in sharp, rapid bursts, as if he is drowning in a terrifying sea only he can see, struggling for air.

Panic flickers in Fang Ma’s eyes, growing with each passing second. _"No, no, my son, my love, please, come back to me,"_ she begs, her voice cracking, tears streaming freely down her face. She cups his face again, colder now with sweat, and gently pats his cheeks, trying to break through the nightmare's hold. _"Listen to Mama. You’re strong. You are the strongest boy I know. You can fight this. Come back to us… please, come back…" she pleads._

She races to get a damp cloth from a nearby basin, wiping his forehead, his neck, trying to cool his fevered skin. She calls his name over and over, her voice a broken melody of fear and love, stroking his back, his arms, holding his hand tightly in both of hers, pouring all her maternal power and love into that simple touch, as if her touch alone could anchor him, could pull him back to the safety of the waking world.

_"Please, please, my love… come back to Mama…" she whispers, her voice barely audible through her tears._

Then after what feels like an eternity, a terrifying stretch of time measured only by her fear and his silent torment, something shifts. Suddenly, Fang Yuan gives a violent, almost convulsive shake, so quick and so powerful that even the sturdy bed shakes beneath him. And then, with an abrupt gasp, Fang Yuan jumps up, his body snapping into a sitting position. His breath is even more rapid now, shallow gasps that tear at the silence. Even after waking up, his body is trembling violently, uncontrollably, sweat pouring off him in waves.

Fang Ma cries out, a raw sound of relief and terror. _"Oh, my love!"_ She instantly wraps her arms around him, pulling him into a tight hug, clinging to him as if trying to shield him, to protect him from whatever unseen horror had invaded his sleep. Tears stream down her face as she presses desperate kisses to his damp cheeks, his forehead, his hair.

_"You're okay now,"_ she repeats again and again, her voice trembling but filled with fierce love. _"You're safe. You're safe. Nothing will happen to you. Nothing will… Mama will protect you. I am here."_ She rocks him gently, her embrace a fortress against the lingering fear.

Fang Yuan is still trembling violently, his body shaking, and his eyes are wide open, filled with a terror that chills Fang Ma to the bone. He hugs Fang Ma back tightly, burying his face in her shoulder, seeking shelter, security, in her embrace.

Fang Zheng, disturbed by the commotion, wakes up and looks at them with startled confusion, his young eyes wide in the dim light.

After what feels like another eternity, measured this time by the slow calming of his trembling body, Fang Yuan gradually begins to relax. He is still trembling, his eyes wide open, but the terror in them is slowly receding, replaced by a deep weariness. He is much calmer now.

Fang Ma gently pulls back slightly, her hands cupping his face, her eyes filled with concern. _"My love,"_ she asks softly, _"was it a bad dream?"_

Fang Yuan responds, his voice trembling, the words barely a whisper. _"Mama, It wasn't a nightmare… but a very, very terrifying voice!"_

Then, as if the mere act of recalling it is too much, his body again starts trembling violently, his muscles spasming uncontrollably. The terror in his eyes returns, sharp and intense. _"The voice… it is so much terrifying that I feel like my whole being… my essence… it has recorded this terror. It is imprinted upon me."_

Fang Ma hugs Fang Yuan tightly again, tears still streaming down her face, her body shaking with empathy and fear for her son. _"Don't worry,"_ she murmurs, her voice thick with emotion. _"Nothing will happen to you. Mama is here. I will protect you, my love."_

In a trembling voice, Fang Yuan recounts the terrifying words. _"The voice… it was… 'How pathetic you are… getting rejected by your own younger naive self.' Mama… the voice was so terrifying… that my whole body can still feel it. And… and besides that one line of sentence, I heard nothing… and saw nothing!"_

Fang Ma holds Fang Yuan tightly, her embrace a desperate attempt to soothe him, to calm the storm raging within him. _"Don't worry,"_ she repeats, tears still flowing freely. _"Mama is here! Mama will protect you! Whatever that voice was, it cannot harm you while I am here."_ She continues to stroke his hair, his back, trying to pour all her love and reassurance into him.

_"Mama, I am scared…"_ Fang Yuan whispers, his voice small and vulnerable. _"Mama, please… please sleep with me tonight. I want to sleep in your arm!"_

At that moment, the door opens quietly, and Fang Sianer enters the room, her eyes blinking sleepily in the dim light. _"What is happening?"_ she asks, her voice soft and confused.

Seeing Fang Yuan's condition, the raw fear on his face, tears immediately gather in her eyes. Without a word, she rushes towards him.

Noticing Fang Sianer's presence, Fang Yuan looks at his little sister. Without a word, he opens his arms and embraces Fang Sianer, pulling her close. She wraps her arms around him in return, holding him tightly.

Fang Ma gives a deep sigh of relief, a wave of calm washing over her as she notices that Fang Yuan is visibly calming down in Fang Sianer's embrace. Fang Ma ponders inwardly, her thoughts focusing on her youngest child. _"Fang Sianer is truly like a miracle,"_ she thinks, a sense of wonder filling her heart. _"When I first came to this world, her presence alone helped me calm down and recall memories of the novel that I had completely forgotten. As days turned into years, I came to understand that even though her cognitive development is slower than others, she is extraordinary in her own way. Her mere presence seems to bring peace and calm to everyone around her, helping them forget their bad memories and feel better."_

Fang Sianer, nestled in her brother's arms, speaks softly, her voice filled with unwavering certainty. _"Don't worry, brother. I am here now. Nothing will happen to you. I will protect you."_

Fang Ma embraces both Fang Yuan and Fang Sianer in her arms, pulling them close, creating a circle of love and comfort. Seeing all these dramatic events unfolding before him, Fang Zheng hesitantly steps forward from his bed, his young face etched with concern, and reaches out tentatively. Seeing his desire to join them, Fang Ma also includes Fang Zheng in her embrace, pulling him into the comforting circle.

The scene is truly heartwarming amidst the lingering fear – a mother embracing her children, a haven of love and security against the unseen terrors of the night, a testament to the strength of family bonds in the face of the unknown.
