The horrifying flood of memories doesn't just recede; it _explodes_ outwards, leaving Fang Yuan gasping, choking on air that feels suddenly thin and poisonous. He is back in the quiet room, the soft lamplight a cruel contrast to the darkness he just witnessed. But the darkness isn't gone; it's inside him now, a chilling, undeniable truth that has shattered his reality.

His body doesn't just tremble; it convulses violently, a terrifying seizure shaking him from head to toe. His eyes, wide open, are no longer filled with the fear of the voice, but with a raw, agonizing horror at _himself_. He sees Yao Le's face, her innocent terror, her desperate pleas, her brutal end – and he sees his own cold, impassive face watching it all. He sees his hand, gently petting the bear, his voice cold as he condemned her. He sees the _refinement_. The monster.

Everything around him seems to go black, the edges of his vision closing in. He can't utter a word, his throat constricted by a silent scream. Now, his condition is worse than ever before. He doesn't understand what he truly is. Is he the Messenger of Love, the boy adored by everyone for his kindness? Or is he this terrifying monster, capable of such unspeakable brutality?

He is even more terrified, more shocked, more utterly broken than he was moments ago in the River of Flowers. Just this morning, he had regained the memory of his previous life, the life where he went mad because he couldn't save innocent lives from monsters. Now, at night, he finds out that _he_ is even worse than all those monsters combined. He always asked why anyone could be that brutal, searching for answers, for solutions, and finding none, he had descended into madness. Now, he finds himself even more brutal, more monstrous, than anything he has ever seen or imagined in his previous life.

His whole body is trembling violently, uncontrollably. All these clashing, opposite identities – the man from his past who couldn't save anyone, who couldn't prevent innocent souls from being destroyed by monsters; the Messenger of Love who saves everyone, helps others, and successfully gives them a better life; and the future self, the demonic monster, worse than any he saw in his previous life, who kills innocent souls with utmost brutality – all these conflicting identities are now tearing him apart, driving him mad.

Fang Yuan has gone mad in this moment, the weight of his past life's actions crashing down on him. He wants to end his life, to escape the horror of what he has done to Yao Le in that memory, but he can't even move. His whole body has frozen, locked in a state of shock and trembling, paralyzed by the terrifying realization of how monstrous he is.

He doesn't know if this is a dream, another layer of nightmare, or if it is real life. He is consumed by guilt, by self-hate, by a paralyzing fear of himself. How could he have done that? How could he have killed his childhood friend, Yao Le, with such cold, calculated brutality?

Suddenly, a voice cuts through the storm in his mind, a voice filled with concern and confusion. _"Brother Fang Yuan! Are you alright? Why are you acting like this? Please… please become normal again."_ It is the voice of Yao Le, and as his eyes struggle to focus, he sees her face, pale with worry, right before him. From the side, Fang Sianer's voice, filled with a desperate love, cries out, _"My love! Please! Please! What's happening?"_ From behind, Fang Ma's voice, raw with a mother's fear and fierce love, reaches him. _"My son, my love! Please don't be afraid. Mama is here! All of us are here! Don't be afraid."_

Seeing Yao Le alive, her face filled with concern, his eyes widen further in disbelief. With his trembling body, his face a mask of fear, shock, and tears that have begun to stream down his face, he violently embraces Yao Le. There was no sound in his cry before, only silent agony, but now, as he clings to her, he is crying loudly, raw, guttural sobs tearing from his throat. He holds her tightly, desperately, as if she is the only real thing in a world gone mad.

After a few moments, as his violent cries subside into ragged sobs, Fang Yuan begins to check all parts of Yao Le's body with frantic, trembling hands. He is still crying, but a desperate relief can be seen in his eyes as he confirms she is unharmed. He grabs her cheeks, her hair, her hands, her thighs, her legs, her chest, touching every part, confirming her reality, her safety. Even though relief is evident in his actions, it is almost lost before his terrified, fearful expression, the horror of the memory still etched on his face.

After checking and confirming that she is truly Yao Le, alive and completely fine, he hugs her tightly again, burying his face in her shoulder, his body still shaking with the aftermath of the trauma. Throughout this time, he hasn't uttered a single word; his brain and mind have faced unimaginable damage from all those clashing memories, all those conflicting identities. They aren't working properly, and Fang Yuan is acting out of instinct only – the instinct to protect, to confirm reality, to cling to the light in the face of overwhelming darkness.

Yao Le is confused, unable to understand the depth of his reaction, but she hugs Fang Yuan back, her young arms wrapping around him, her voice filled with gentle reassurance. _"Don't worry, brother Fang Yuan! I'm okay! I'm here!"_

Fang Sianer and Fang Ma join the embrace, comforting Fang Yuan, trying to calm him down with their words, their touch, their unwavering love. Hours pass by in the quiet room, the only sounds Fang Yuan's ragged breathing and the soft murmurs of comfort from his mother and sister. He is still embracing Yao Le tightly, clinging to her, and it seems he can't even hear or understand their words, lost in the aftermath of the internal storm.

Fang Ma's face looks very empty, a deep worry clouding her features. _"It looks like the novel's future demonic Fang Yuan is trying to take over my Fang Yuan,"_ she thinks, her heart aching with fear. _"But I will never let my son be taken. I will protect him at all costs, even if it costs my life, because now you are not the Fang Yuan in the novel, you are my son, my love, my everything."_ A chilling realization dawns on her as she connects the dots. _"Now that I recall the horrifying bear scene from the novel, the scene where I dropped the book… If I think about it properly, Fang Yuan's condition became like this after seeing Yao Le's face and hearing her voice. And then he checked Yao Le again and again, desperately, to confirm that she is alright. And now, he is embracing Yao Le for hours, clinging to her, unable to even hear or understand anything, just embracing her. This means Fang Yuan has seen something very bad about Yao Le in that memory, something that terrified him to his core. He must have seen the bear scene, the horrifying moment where he fed Yao Le to the bear in his past life. And if I recall what Fang Yuan told me yesterday, about being 'rejected by your own past younger self,' it indicates that the future self, the demonic entity, must be trying to take control of my son. No, I will not let it happen. I will fight with every fiber of my being to protect him."_

And then, with a resolute face, her determination hardening, she speaks to Yao Le, her voice gentle despite the gravity of the situation. _"Yao Le, it looks like Fang Yuan really… really needs you right now. He really likes you, and it seems he's not going to let go of your embrace anytime soon."_

Yao Le responds shyly, her face still pale but a faint blush rising to her cheeks, unsure how to react to the intensity of Fang Yuan's embrace and Fang Ma's words. _"It's… it's not a big deal, Mistress Fang Ma. I don't mind staying."_

_"Then,"_ Fang Ma says, a small, grateful smile touching her lips, _"why don't you sleep just like that, with him holding you? It looks like my son won't let you go today."_

She shyly responds affirmatively, nodding her head, agreeing to stay by his side.

Then, Fang Ma gently helps Fang Yuan and Yao Le lie down on the bed, ensuring Fang Yuan is still holding Yao Le tightly, providing him with the comfort and anchor he desperately needs. Then, with practiced movements, Fang Ma uses several martial artifacts, channeling her newfound martial essence into them, to give Fang Yuan a boost of energy, a subtle healing touch. These artifacts will also help him become calm, and remove any lingering hunger or fatigue.

Then Fang Ma says to Fang Sianer, who is still sobbing quietly, watching Fang Yuan with worried eyes. _"My Sianer, why don't you sleep beside your brother? You know that your brother really loves you, and if you sleep beside him, close to him, he will recover soon. Your presence helps him, my love."_

_"Really!"_ Fang Sianer’s eyes widen with a flicker of hope. Then, without hesitation, she moves from where she was sitting and lies down beside Fang Yuan, completing the protective circle around him.

Fang Ma watches them, a mother's love and worry etched on her face. _"I have checked Fang Sianer's martial core and essence,"_ she ponders, her mind working to understand the mysteries unfolding before her. _"And my estimation was right; there is a peaceful, healing, comfortable aura around Fang Sianer. Her presence alone seems to calm the storm within him, to help him recover quickly. And now that I recall my memory of my previous life, the knowledge about martial essence colors… green represents healing. And her martial core and essence are also green. That means it must have a direct healing attribute, a powerful one. And it must be very rare."_ A glimmer of hope, fragile but persistent, ignites in her heart. Perhaps, with their love, with Sianer's unique healing presence, they can pull Fang Yuan back from the abyss, from the darkness that threatens to consume him.
