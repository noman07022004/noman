Hours drift by, heavy with unspoken fear. Fang Yuan remains trapped in his silent torment, his body a landscape of tremors, his gaze fixed, a prisoner of terror, on Yao Le. The initial cries of Fang Ma, Fang Sianer, and Yao Le have subsided into exhausted sobs, a quiet testament to their enduring love and helplessness.

Fang Ma watches her son, his fragile form shaking beneath the covers, his lips moving soundlessly. His eyes, wide and haunted, never leave Yao Le. She observes the almost imperceptible movements of his trembling hands, reaching out hesitantly, as if drawn by an invisible force towards the girl, a gesture perhaps of sorrow, a silent plea for forgiveness for a guilt he doesn't yet understand the source of, a guilt he feels he doesn't deserve.

Her mind races, piecing together the fragments of the past hours. _"Before he… before he retreated again,"_ she thinks, her voice a choked whisper in her mind, _"he desperately checked Yao Le, held her so tightly for so long, lost in a world beyond our reach, driven only by instinct. And now… now he wakes, sees her, and this… this terror."_ Her gaze sweeps over his trembling body. _"No elixir, no artifact has touched this. It's something deeper."_ She returns her attention to his face, his petrified gaze locked on Yao Le. _"His eyes… they are filled with fear, yes, but it's not the fear of _her_. It's… something else. A fear within himself."_ She watches his trembling mouth. _"His lips… they move, trying to form words, but nothing comes. It's as if the very language has been stolen from him."_ Her gaze falls on his trembling hands. _"Reaching… so hesitantly reaching for her, yet unable to close the distance, as if an invisible barrier holds him back, a profound hesitation… a fear of his own touch."_

Then, the scattered pieces of her fragmented knowledge of the novel begin to align with chilling clarity. _"The novel…"_ she thinks, a shiver running down her spine. _"The future self… returning with memories, experiences… a cold, calculating monster. Using the bear, the girl… to refine a martial elixir. I stopped reading right after that horrifying scene. There was nothing… _nothing_ like this in the beginning. No immediate terror upon seeing a specific person. The forceful insertion of memories… that's it! That must be it! His future self is trying to force those horrific memories into my Fang Yuan's mind, and Yao Le… Yao Le must be that girl."_ A wave of nausea washes over her, her own body trembling. _"To suddenly see… to _remember_ doing something so monstrous… kidnapping an innocent child, feeding her… No! I can't… I won't think about it."_ Tears well up again, silent sobs shaking her. _"What must he be feeling? Seeing such brutality… and believing _he_ did it?"_

But a fierce protectiveness flares within her, a mother's unwavering love. _"No!"_ she resolves fiercely in her mind. _"That brutality… that darkness… that wasn't _my_ son. That was the Fang Yuan of the novel. This is my Fang Yuan, my love!"_ A moment of desperate calculation follows. _"Should I… should I keep Yao Le away from him? Would that bring him peace?"_ A chilling counter-thought surfaces. _"But the novel… his future self… the ruthlessness… would that truly solve anything?"_

Her gaze softens as she watches Yao Le, who is whispering softly to Fang Yuan, her voice filled with gentle concern. **"Brother Fang Yuan… I'm here. Please… please be alright."**

Suddenly, an idea sparks in Fang Ma's mind, a fragile beacon of hope. *__"Yes!"__ she thinks, a sudden surge of adrenaline coursing through her. Fang Sianer and Yao Le look at her, startled by the sudden intensity in her eyes. But Fang Ma doesn't speak aloud yet, her mind racing. _"I need to make him believe… it was just a nightmare. A terrible, _unreal_ dream. He has done nothing wrong. The memories… they aren't _his_ memories. They are not real."_

Her gaze focuses, her determination hardening. She will fight this darkness, this phantom of a future that will not come to pass. She will anchor her son to the present, to the reality of their love.

Fang Ma, her heart heavy yet a flicker of a plan igniting within her, moves swiftly. She sits beside Yao Le, her hand resting briefly on the girl's shoulder, a silent acknowledgment of her crucial role. Then, she turns to Fang Sianer, who remains kneeling at Fang Yuan's head, her brow furrowed in unwavering concentration. **"Fang Sianer,"** Fang Ma says, her voice firm despite the tremor of emotion, **"prepare yourself. You need to continue injecting your martial essence into Fang Yuan's martial core, but this time, focus on channeling it from his back. Try to soothe the… the turmoil."**

Turning to Yao Le, Fang Ma’s gaze softens with a mixture of gratitude and purpose. **"Yao Le,"** she says, her voice gentle but resolute, **"you will be crucial in helping Fang Yuan find his way back to us. Be brave, my dear."** Yao Le, her eyes still wide with lingering fear but understanding the gravity of the moment, nods firmly.

With gentle but firm movements, Fang Ma helps Fang Yuan sit up, cradling him against her chest, his back now exposed. She quickly removes his shirt. **"Fang Sianer, begin,"** she instructs, her voice tight with anticipation. Fang Sianer, without hesitation, shifts her position and starts channeling her soothing martial essence into Fang Yuan's back. A visible calmness begins to settle over his trembling form, slow but undeniable.

Fixing her gaze on Fang Yuan’s still-fearful eyes, Fang Ma speaks, her voice filled with a mother’s unwavering conviction. **"My love,"** she says, her embrace firm, **"all those terrible things you saw… they were just bad dreams. Not real. Not even a little bit true. And you… you have never done anything like that. Mama knows you. Mama knows that in her heart. You don’t have to just believe me, my precious boy. Check for yourself."**

Holding him securely with one arm, she gently takes his trembling hand and extends it towards Yao Le. **"Look,"** she whispers, guiding his hand to Yao Le’s soft cheek. **"This is Yao Le. She is completely fine. You have done nothing bad to her."**

Yao Le, understanding instinctively, reaches out and holds Fang Yuan’s hand with both of hers, her gaze filled with earnest sincerity. **"Yes, Brother Fang Yuan,"** she says, her voice clear despite the tears that still cling to her lashes. **"I am alright. You have done nothing wrong."**

Fang Ma guides his hand to Yao Le’s other cheek, then to her small nose, then to her hand, even gently touching her chest, her waist, her thigh. Though a faint blush rises on Yao Le’s face at the intimate touch, she bravely meets Fang Yuan’s gaze, even placing her own hands over his, guiding his touch. **"Look, my love,"** Fang Ma continues, her voice thick with emotion. **"She is completely fine. You have checked her completely, haven’t you? You have done nothing brutal or bad to her. This was all just a terrible nightmare, a trick the devil is playing on you to try and take you away from us. But in reality… you have done nothing wrong, and you _will_ never do anything wrong. Can’t you see how everyone loves you? How they admire your kindness? They call you the Messenger of Love. The devil is jealous of that light in you, trying to make you into someone you are not, so you will stop helping others, stop bringing smiles, stop being the Messenger of Love. But Mama knows… one day, you will become the living embodiment of love itself."** The weight of her words overwhelms her, and her sobs return, wracking her body.

Yao Le, holding Fang Yuan’s hands firmly in hers, brings them to her own cheeks, pressing them against her tear-streaked skin. **"Yes, Brother Fang Yuan,"** she says, her voice trembling but resolute. **"The devil doesn’t want to see you become love itself. It is fearful of your light. Look at me. I am completely fine. You have done nothing bad to me. And I believe in you, Brother Fang Yuan. I believe that one day, you will be love itself."**

Slowly, almost imperceptibly, a change flickers in Fang Yuan’s eyes. Without prompting, his own hand gently lifts, his trembling fingers lightly brushing Yao Le’s cheek, his gaze searching hers. He who couldn’t bear to look at her before now meets her eyes, a flicker of recognition, of dawning understanding, within them.

Hours continue to pass. Fang Sianer remains deeply focused, her steady stream of martial essence a soothing balm to Fang Yuan’s tormented core. He leans against Fang Ma, her unwavering embrace a source of comfort, while Yao Le remains close, a tangible proof against the horrors of his memory. Fang Ma and Yao Le continue their gentle reassurances, weaving a tapestry of love and truth around him, trying to anchor him to the present.

Finally, his voice raspy, hesitant, but undeniably _there_, Fang Yuan utters a single, heart-wrenching sentence, his gaze locked on Yao Le’s tear-filled eyes, tears now streaming down his own face. **"Yao Le… I… am… happy… that… it… was… just… a bad… dream… and… you… are… okay…"**

A choked sob escapes Yao Le. She throws her arms around Fang Yuan, hugging him tightly, her own tears flowing freely. **"Brother Fang Yuan! I am fine! I am fine! I am so happy!"**

Fang Ma’s embrace tightens, her own tears of relief mingling with her sobs. **"Yes, my love,"** she whispers fiercely, pressing a kiss to his hair. **"Just a bad dream. Nothing else. You have done nothing wrong."**

From behind, Fang Sianer, her own martial essence completely depleted, overcome with emotion at hearing his voice, simply hugs him tightly, her silent sobs conveying the overwhelming joy that words cannot express. **"My love! My love! You are finally talking! I am so very happy…"**

The room is filled with the raw beauty of their love, a symphony of tears, relief, and the fragile dawn of healing.
