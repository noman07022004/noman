Another year passes quickly, a blur of days filled with the simple joys of family life. Now, Fang Yuan is four years old, Fang Zheng is three and a half, and Fang Sianer is three.

Fang Yuan, even at this tender age, is as precocious as ever, absorbing knowledge and skills with an almost unnerving speed, mastering things that would take many a lifetime to grasp. Fang Zheng's development progresses at a normal, healthy pace, a typical child exploring the world with innocent curiosity. But the progress of Fang Sianer remains a source of quiet concern. Though her physical growth appears normal in every other aspect, her small stature is noticeable. The real issue, however, lies in her communication. Even at three years old, she struggles with the simplest forms of interaction. It is as if, despite her chronological age, her mental development lags far behind, more akin to that of a child younger than one year old.

During this past year, Fang Ma has dedicated herself to her children, spending countless hours with them, weaving a rich tapestry of precious memories. A profound happiness fills her heart, a deep contentment at having been given this second chance. She understands that the future remains uncertain, shrouded in the mists of the novel's plot, but she vows to cherish each and every moment, these fleeting joys becoming anchors for the rest of her life. The bond she shares with her children has grown so strong, so undeniable, that she can no longer even entertain the thought of not being their real mother. Her love for them is fierce and unconditional, a protective instinct so powerful that she would readily sacrifice her own life to shield them from any harm.

Throughout this year, doctors have been frequent visitors to their home, diligently monitoring Fang Ma's condition. After numerous examinations and careful consideration, their conclusion is that her miraculous return from death can be attributed to her past life as a powerful healing martial master. They surmise that all her martial power was expended in the act of revival, leaving her now as a mere mortal, devoid of any martial abilities. The title of martial master no longer applies to her.

With the loss of her martial power, Fang Ma is no longer the leader of the medicine hall. An experienced woman who previously served as her assistant has now stepped into that role. But Fang Ma holds no resentment, no regret. Her only concern, her sole focus, is spending every possible moment with her beloved children.

As Fang Ma's inherited memories are primarily tied to those with whom the real Fang Ma shared deep emotional bonds – Fang Fu and their children – she finds herself content with their company. She prefers quiet moments with them, relishing their presence, and doesn't feel compelled to engage in extensive communication with others.

Dong Tu and his wife, Dong Wi, have moved into the mansion, their presence subtly shifting the power dynamics within the household. Dong Wi has quietly but firmly established her control over the daily affairs of the mansion, while Dong Tu has subtly taken over the management of all financial matters. Fang Ma remains cautious, her instincts honed by her knowledge of the novel, keenly observing their actions, aware of how they treated Fang Yuan in the original story. However, she has so far been unable to assert any real control over the household, let alone the financial sector.

Dong Tu and Gu Yue Bo have been frequent visitors, their interactions with Fang Ma and her children marked by an almost exaggerated gentleness. For the first few months, they showered Fang Ma with gifts and engaging conversations, attempting to win her favor. When Fang Ma remained largely indifferent to their efforts, they shifted their strategy, subtly trying to ingratiate themselves with her children. They often make remarks laden with false sympathy, such as, _"It is really sad that these innocent children have to grow up without the love of a father. I truly hope I can somehow help fill that void."_

A hidden rivalry simmers beneath the surface as Dong Tu and Gu Yue Bo both realize the other is vying for Fang Ma's attention. Even though Dong Tu's martial level has dropped from Rank 3 to Rank 2 after the injuries he sustained in the battle where Fang Fu perished, he refuses to show any weakness in front of Gu Yue Bo. This is despite the fact that Gu Yue Bo holds the dual authority of Clan Head and Rank 4 martial master.

Dong Tu's motivations are clear. Firstly, Fang Ma now possesses immense wealth, inherited from Fang Fu. Secondly, she is undeniably beautiful, her charm and grace undiminished by her recent ordeal. Thirdly, despite his persistent efforts with his wife, he has been unable to conceive a child. He believes that if he can somehow manage to marry Fang Ma, he will automatically gain control of her considerable wealth, avoiding the risky and complicated schemes he would otherwise need to employ to acquire a portion of it. Furthermore, he would gain a beautiful wife and instantly become the father of three children. For these reasons, he is even willing to compete against the Clan Leader for her hand. He reasons that with his greatest adversary, Fang Fu, now gone, he has a chance. While Fang Fu was alive, Dong Tu felt overshadowed, but now, with Fang Fu’s demise, he can seize everything that was Fang Fu's – his wife, his children, his reputation, his wealth – and finally step into the spotlight, unchallenged.

For the Clan Leader, Gu Yue Bo, the reasons are equally apparent. His wife passed away many years ago, and since then, he has dedicated himself solely to cultivating his martial strength. Now, in his fifties, he remains without a wife or children. His position as Clan Head is secure, with no apparent threats to his authority. If he were to succeed in making Fang Ma his wife, he would not only gain access to her substantial wealth but also acquire three ready-made children.

Why are both Dong Tu and Gu Yue Bo so willing to embrace children who are not their own? The answer lies in a well-known truth among cultivators: the more powerful one becomes, the more difficult it is to conceive. As a cultivator's power increases, their very DNA undergoes significant modifications, often resulting in infertility, no matter how diligently they may try to have children with their partners.
