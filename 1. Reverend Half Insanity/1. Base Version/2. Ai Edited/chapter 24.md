After a few moments, Fang Ma takes Fang Yuan and Fang Sianer by their hands, and they step out of the mansion into the bright afternoon sunlight. The warmth of the sun on their faces is a gentle contrast to the hushed anticipation that seems to ripple through the air as they emerge.

As they begin to walk down the street, a wave of recognition washes over the villagers. Faces light up, smiles bloom, and one by one, they approach, their greetings carrying genuine warmth and respect.

An old woman, her back slightly hunched with age and her face a roadmap of hardship endured, shuffles forward, her eyes brimming with unshed tears of gratitude as she gazes at Fang Yuan. **_"Young Master, the Messenger of Love,"_** she whispers, her voice trembling with emotion, **_"your generous donation… it wasn't just money, child. It was hope. I was bedridden with pain, unable to care for myself, a burden to my family. Your kindness allowed me to afford the medicine, and now…"_** She straightens her back slightly, a flicker of her former strength returning. **_"Now I can finally work again, I can contribute, I can feel like myself again. You gave me back my dignity, Young Master. Thank you."_**

Fang Yuan’s face softens, a genuine warmth spreading across his features. **_"Thank you,"_** he replies sincerely, his voice filled with heartfelt empathy. **_"I am just happy I could help. Please, grandmother, if you ever need anything at all, don't hesitate to ask."_**

Suddenly, a young boy, no older than ten, his eyes sparkling with an almost feverish excitement, pushes his way through the small crowd. **_"Young Master, the Messenger of Love!"_** he exclaims, his voice ringing with youthful enthusiasm and a hint of past desperation. **_"You… you saved my life! You helped me get a job in your business when my family was starving. Now…"_** He gestures proudly to his clean, though simple, clothes. **_"Now I haven't gone hungry even once! Look! I even bought a new dress for my little sister!"_** His face beams with pride as he turns and calls out, his voice filled with affection, **_"Hey, little sis! Come here quickly, or you might miss your chance to thank the Messenger of Love!"_** A small girl, around seven years old, her eyes wide with a mixture of shyness and adoration, shuffles forward, her tiny hands clasped nervously behind her back. She stands before Fang Yuan, her gaze fixed on his worn shoes, her nervousness almost a tangible thing. Then, taking a deep, shuddering breath, she suddenly bows her head and thrusts her hands forward, revealing a delicate flower crown woven from brightly colored blossoms, the fragrance filling the air. **_"Messenger of Love,"_** she squeaks out, her voice barely a whisper, thick with emotion, **_"please… please accept this little gift from me. I made it… with my own hands."_**

The young boy beams with pride, his chest puffed out. **_"Messenger of Love, it might be a small gift, but my sister… she insisted. She worked so hard, going into the wilderness, carefully choosing each flower for its beauty and its scent. She wanted to make something truly special for you."_**

Fang Yuan’s eyes soften, deeply touched by the innocent offering. **_"You really didn't have to do this,"_** he says softly, his voice filled with genuine appreciation. But before he can say more, Fang Ma gently intervenes, her smile radiating warmth and understanding. **_"Fang Yuan, my love,"_** she says, her voice encouraging and tender, **_"why don't you bow your head for her? Let her place the flower crown on you with her own hands. You can see how much love she put into making it, and how beautiful it looks."_**

Fang Sianer claps her hands excitedly, her eyes sparkling with pure joy. **_"My love,"_** she exclaims, her voice filled with childlike delight, **_"you would look even more gorgeous with that flower crown! Like a prince!"_**

With a gentle, loving smile, Fang Yuan lowers his head. The little girl, her cheeks flushed a delicate pink with shyness and excitement, carefully, reverently, places the flower crown on his dark hair, her small fingers trembling slightly with the weight of the moment.

With the crown of colorful flowers adorning his head, Fang Yuan looks even more handsome, his youthful charm and inherent kindness radiating outwards, amplified by the simple, heartfelt gift. A collective sigh of admiration and affection ripples through the small crowd, their hearts touched by the pure innocence of the exchange.

Fang Ma gazes at her son, a soft, almost tearful smile gracing her lips, her heart swelling with an overwhelming mixture of pride and affection. **_"My love looks truly cute and charming,"_** she murmurs, her voice thick with emotion, a silent prayer forming in her heart for his continued kindness.

A young mother, her face pale and drawn with the memory of past suffering, clutches a small child tightly in her arms, her eyes welling up with tears of profound gratitude as she looks at Fang Yuan. **_"Young Master, Messenger of Love,"_** she whispers, her voice choked with emotion, trembling with the lingering echoes of fear, **_"thank you… thank you for giving me the opportunity to work in your business. Because of you, my daughter and I… we are finally able to live a happy life. Before…"_** Her voice breaks, the image of her past hardship flashing before her eyes. **_"Before, it was so hard… my husband… he was a servant to a martial master. He worked tirelessly, but when he was injured and no longer useful, the master… he just… he killed him, as if his life meant nothing."_** Fresh tears stream down her face as she clutches her daughter closer. **_"But you, Young Master… after hearing my story, you didn't just offer sympathy. You helped us get justice. You even requested that the master be punished for his cruelty. You gave us back our hope, Young Master. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."_**

A middle-aged man, his shoulders bearing the weight of years of silent oppression, approaches, bowing deeply, his forehead almost touching the ground as a sign of his profound respect. **_"Young Master, the policy you implemented for us mortals… it has changed everything,"_** he says, his voice filled with a newfound strength and dignity. **_"There is no longer such a vast, insurmountable difference between a martial master and a normal human in the eyes of the law, thanks to you. Even a powerful martial master cannot get away with committing injustice against a mortal without facing punishment. Before, we were treated worse than ants, our lives held no value. But now…"_** He pauses, a hint of defiance and pride in his voice. **_"Now, we can even stand against them if we are right, knowing there is a chance for justice. You have given us a voice, Young Master."_** He lowers his voice, a shadow passing over his face. **_"Many martial masters are not happy with you, Young Master. I have heard whispers in the shadows… they secretly want to eliminate you, to restore the old order. But they don't dare show any disrespect openly, and they are even afraid to speak of it amongst themselves, fearing the other might be a follower, a protector, of the Messenger of Love."_**

A young woman, around twenty years old, her eyes shining with unshed tears that speak volumes of past trauma, approaches Fang Yuan, her movements filled with a heartfelt reverence and a lingering fragility. **_"Messenger of Love,"_** she whispers, bowing her head so low that her dark hair almost touches the ground, **_"I… I can never thank you enough. You saved me from the abusive hand of a Rank 1 martial master. He… he treated me like I was less than dirt. You not only rescued me from that living hell but also gave me a generous donation, enough to start over. You even bought me a small shop in the market where I can finally run my own business and be free… truly free for the first time in my life."_** Her voice trembles with emotion as she holds out a basket filled with fresh, ripe fruit, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the darkness she has escaped. **_"Please… please accept this humble offering. It is a small token of my eternal gratitude."_**

Before Fang Yuan can reach for the basket, Fang Ma steps forward, her expression suddenly hardening, a protective fire igniting in her eyes. **_"How can you offer my love this way?"_** she asks, her tone sharp, carrying an undercurrent of possessiveness. The young woman freezes, her eyes widening in fear, her breath catching in her throat as if she has committed a grave offense. **_"Messenger of Love,"_** she stammers, her voice trembling like a leaf in the wind, **_"I… I should have known my boundary. Please… please forgive me."_**

Fang Yuan immediately steps forward, his brow furrowed with concern, his hand instinctively reaching out towards the trembling girl. **_"No,"_** he says gently but firmly, his voice filled with protective warmth, **_"you haven't done anything wrong. Please don't be sad."_** He turns to Fang Ma, his eyes questioning. **_"Mama, what has she done wrong? She is offering us a gift from her heart."_**

Fang Ma gestures dismissively at the basket, her initial sternness softening slightly but still carrying a hint of disapproval. **_"Why is she offering you such a small amount of fruit? We have so much more, baskets overflowing, in our own home."_** A low murmur of agreement ripples through the nearby crowd, their eyes fixed on the young woman with a mixture of pity and judgment, as if she has indeed made a significant social blunder.

**_"How can you say that, Mama?"_** Fang Yuan exclaims, his voice rising slightly, a hint of indignation coloring his tone. **_"She is offering us this from her own little business, earned with her own hard work and effort. Can't you see the love and sincerity in this gesture?"_** The young woman looks utterly frightened and upset, tears welling in her eyes, convinced she has made a terrible mistake, that she has somehow deeply offended the Messenger of Love and his powerful mother. She whispers, her voice choked with tears, **_"Please… please forgive me, Messenger of Love. I truly didn't mean any disrespect."_**

Fang Yuan quickly steps forward and gently places his hands on her trembling shoulders, his gaze filled with unwavering kindness and reassurance. **_"Don't cry,"_** he says softly, his voice a soothing balm. **_"Don't cry. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. Please don't mind Mama. She just… she worries about me."_**

Fang Ma sighs dramatically, though a hint of amusement flickers in her eyes. **_"If you truly wish to seek forgiveness,"_** she says, her tone softening slightly but still carrying an air of playful expectation, **_"you must cut up the fruit and feed my son with your own hand. That is how you can truly show your love and gratitude. Otherwise, how can you truly show your love just by giving something that is readily available in our mansion?"_** The young woman looks at Fang Ma with wide, astonished eyes, a flicker of hope replacing the fear. She quickly sets down the basket and, with trembling hands but a determined expression, begins to skillfully slice open a juicy mango. **_"You really don't have to do that,"_** Fang Yuan says softly, feeling a wave of awkwardness wash over him.

Fang Ma raises a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. **_"If you don't like it, my love, you don't have to take it."_**

**_"No, I love it,"_** Fang Yuan says quickly, not wanting to cause any more distress to the already flustered girl. The young woman extends a piece of the ripe mango gently towards Fang Yuan’s mouth, her hand still shaking slightly. He smiles warmly and takes a bite, the sweet juice dripping down his chin. **_"Give me one too!"_** Fang Sianer exclaims, her eyes sparkling with anticipation, completely oblivious to the underlying tension. Tears still flowing down her face, but now mixed with a bright, happy smile, the young woman offers a piece of mango to Fang Sianer, who eagerly takes it with a giggle. Fang Sianer then holds out a piece to Fang Yuan. **_"My love, eat this one too."_** Fang Yuan smiles and takes the piece, thanking both Fang Sianer and the young woman with a grateful nod. The young woman’s face is now completely flushed, her mind reeling from the unexpected turn of events, a shy smile beginning to bloom on her lips.

Seeing this, Fang Ma turns to Fang Yuan, a teasing glint in her eyes. **_"My love, this girl clearly loves you very much, can't you see? Do you truly love her in return?"_**

**_"Of course, I love her!"_** Fang Yuan exclaims, a hint of panic in his voice, completely misinterpreting his mother’s playful question, thinking she is asking about his general kindness and care for others. The young woman’s blush deepens to a fiery red.

Fang Ma raises an eyebrow again, a mischievous smile playing on her lips. **_"Then why don't you show your love by feeding her a piece?"_**

**_"What!"_** Fang Yuan exclaims, his face turning a shade redder.

**_"Then you don't love her!"_** Fang Ma teases, her eyes twinkling.

**_"No! Okay!"_** Fang Yuan says quickly, picking up another piece of mango and shyly holding it out towards the young woman’s mouth. Her eyes widen in surprise, then soften with a mixture of shyness and burgeoning hope. She leans forward and takes a delicate bite, her face now as red as a ripe tomato. Fang Yuan then offers a piece to Fang Sianer. **_"You take one too, My Sianer."_** Fang Sianer happily obliges, her mouth already watering. **_"Mama, open your mouth,"_** Fang Yuan says, holding out the last piece of mango to his mother. **_"Take this one."_** Fang Ma takes the mango from Fang Yuan’s hand and says, her voice filled with warmth and affection, **_"How kind of you, my love. You are truly kind and considerate."_** She pulls Fang Yuan into a loving hug, a silent message of approval passing between them.

As they continue their walk, a middle-aged martial master, his face bearing the scars of past battles and his eyes reflecting a newfound peace, steps forward from the crowd, bowing respectfully before Fang Yuan, his movements carrying a genuine humility. **_"Messenger of Love,"_** he says, his voice filled with heartfelt gratitude, **_"I requested your help in finding work, a purpose beyond endless fighting, and you gave me a job as a guard for your goods. I am now living a happy life with my wife and children. Before, I was always worried about their future, as I had to take on dangerous missions, never knowing if I would return home. Now, I don't have to worry so much, as the work is safe and stable, and even if something were to happen to me, I know your policy of treating mortals and martial masters equally would ensure my family can live a respectful life, free from the exploitation we once faced. You have given us security, Young Master."_** He gestures to the side, his eyes filled with love and pride. **_"Hey, you three, come forward."_** A woman with a young boy and a girl hesitantly steps forward, their expressions nervous, especially the little girl who clings to her mother's leg. They all bow their heads deeply. **_"Greetings to the Messenger of Love,"_** they say in unison, their voices filled with a mixture of awe and gratitude.

**_"You don't have to do that,"_** Fang Yuan says kindly, his smile gentle and reassuring. The mother speaks, her voice filled with deep sincerity. **_"I have discussed it with my husband, and we have decided that our son and daughter… they would like to devote their lives to you, Messenger of Love, to serve you in any way you need."_** Fang Yuan’s eyes widen in alarm, a look of genuine discomfort crossing his face. **_"You really don't have to do that! They have their own lives to live, their own paths to forge!"_** He quickly kneels down and shakes hands with the boy and girl, his smile warm and genuine. **_"If you two ever need anything at all, anything at all, just come and find me, okay? Don't hesitate."_**

At that moment, a joyous wave of children, a mix of boys and girls with bright, eager faces, come rushing forward, their small hands clutching colorful wildflowers. **_"We greet the Messenger of Love!"_** they exclaim in unison, their voices filled with innocent adoration, presenting Fang Yuan with a delicate flower bracelet woven with care. Fang Ma smiles warmly at the children. **_"Why don't you put it on his wrist with your own hands?"_** she suggests. The children eagerly reach out and gently place the bracelet on Fang Yuan’s wrist, their small fingers brushing against his skin. Then, their eyes widening with delight, they also give another flower bracelet to Fang Sianer, who beams with happiness, and even present one to Fang Ma, who accepts it with a gracious smile. A young boy from the group speaks up, his voice filled with heartfelt gratitude. **_"Messenger of Love, we are orphans, and thanks to your incredible kindness, we are living in the orphanage you established. We have warm beds and get good meals every day. We are safe now, because of you."_** A girl adds, her voice trembling slightly as she recounts her past trauma, **_"Before I came to the orphanage, I was living on the streets. My parents… they were killed by a cruel martial master."_** Her voice breaks, and tears begin to flow down her cheeks.

Fang Yuan immediately steps forward and gently pulls her into a comforting hug, his young heart aching for her past suffering. **_"Don't worry,"_** he whispers, patting her back reassuringly. **_"I made sure that martial master was punished for what he did. And it was because of stories like yours that I asked my Mama to establish an orphanage, a safe haven where all children like you can live happily and safely, never having to fear again."_** The girl hugs him back tightly, sobbing for a moment before pulling away, her eyes still wet but now filled with a glimmer of hope. **_"Messenger of Love, you have done more than enough for us. We want to do something for you in return."_** Fang Yuan shakes his head gently, his kindness unwavering. **_"You don't have to do anything. Just be happy and safe."_**

**_"Young Master,"_** another orphan boy says, his voice filled with a hopeful eagerness, **_"we heard you are going to attend the awakening ceremony soon and then go to the academy?"_**

**_"Yes, that's right. Only one week left,"_** Fang Yuan confirms, a hint of excitement in his voice.

**_"Messenger of Love,"_** the first girl continues, her eyes downcast with a familiar pang of sadness, **_"we orphans… we don't even get the chance to attend the awakening ceremony. It's only for those with families and standing in the clan. If you could somehow… make it so we are allowed to attend, even just to watch, every other girl and boy like me would be grateful to you forever."_**

**_"What? You're not allowed?"_** Fang Yuan asks, his brow furrowed in surprise and concern.

**_"No, we aren't,"_** the boy confirms sadly, his shoulders slumping slightly.

Fang Yuan looks at Fang Ma, his expression questioning, a silent plea for understanding in his eyes. **_"Mama, is that true?"_**

Fang Ma nods gently, her gaze filled with sympathy for the orphans. **_"Yes, my love. It has always been the tradition."_**

**_"Then can't you… can't we make it happen so that everyone gets a chance to awaken their talent, or at least witness the ceremony?"_** Fang Yuan asks earnestly, his voice filled with a passionate desire for fairness.

Fang Ma smiles, her eyes filled with immense affection for her son’s compassionate heart. **_"If you say so, my love, what can I do but obey? You are the Messenger of Love, after all. Your wish is my command."_**

**_"Then how about we allow everyone to attend the awakening ceremony?"_** Fang Yuan asks, his voice filled with hopeful anticipation.

**_"Okay, my love,"_** Fang Ma agrees readily, her decision immediate and unwavering. **_"I will talk about this with the Clan Leader immediately, and from next year, everyone who is old enough will be able to attend the awakening ceremony. I promise."_**

Fang Yuan turns to the girl who had first spoken, who is now standing before him, looking around shyly, a faint blush still lingering on her cheeks, seemingly still overwhelmed by the fact that she had hugged him. **_"Don't worry,"_** he says with a reassuring smile that reaches his kind eyes. **_"You all can attend from next year if you are fifteen or older. You will all get your chance."_** The girl’s eyes widen with pure, unadulterated joy, and she thanks Fang Yuan profusely, her voice choked with happy tears, still unable to meet his gaze directly, overcome with shyness and gratitude. The other boys and girls erupt in cheers, their faces radiant with hope. **_"Thank you, Messenger of Love! You have given us a way to fulfill our dream! Thank you!"_**

Then, a girl who looks to be around Fang Yuan’s age steps forward from the crowd, her expression initially grateful, but quickly turning to a deep sorrow that shadows her young face. **_"Greetings to the Messenger of Love,"_** she says, her voice trembling slightly, carrying the weight of a year's worth of unspoken pain. **_"I am truly grateful for the help my father received from you, Young Master. Because of you, our lives were really happy… until last year."_** Suddenly, she kneels before Fang Yuan, her body shaking with silent sobs. Tears stream down her face, leaving glistening trails on her pale cheeks.

Fang Yuan immediately jumps forward to help her up, his face etched with deep concern and a growing sense of helplessness. **_"What happened last year? If anything is wrong, please tell me. I will help you, I promise."_**

**_"Last year… in the awakening ceremony… I awakened no talent,"_** she whispers, her voice a broken sob, her body wracked with despair. Fang Yuan looks at her, his heart sinking with empathy, unsure of how to respond to such profound grief, a grief he now understands is shared by many in this village.

Hearing her words, Fang Ma ponders to herself, a thoughtful frown creasing her brow, **_"This was unexpected. I was just thinking about how to make Fang Yuan understand that talent isn't everything, that one can achieve great things through hard work even without innate talent. But this… this raw pain… it is different."_**

Unable to find any comforting words that feel adequate, Fang Yuan simply hugs the girl again, hoping to offer some small measure of solace through physical comfort and shared humanity. The girl clings to him, her tears soaking his clothes, and hugs him back tightly, her small frame trembling with the intensity of her despair. **_"Messenger of Love,"_** she sobs, her voice filled with a heartbreaking plea, **_"why is the world so unfair? It isn't even giving me a chance. I also want to try… I am very determined, I want to cultivate, to become strong… but why am I not getting any chance?"_** Fang Yuan holds her tightly, feeling the depth of her anguish, sensing a profound sense of injustice in her words. Finding no immediate answer, his own heart heavy with sorrow, he looks towards Fang Ma, his eyes pleading for guidance, for a solution to this widespread pain.

Seeing the unspoken question, the raw empathy in Fang Yuan’s eyes, Fang Ma asks, her voice carrying across the now silent and expectant crowd, **_"Is there anyone else here who has had a similar experience?"_** Immediately, a wave of people step forward, some old, their faces etched with decades of disappointment, some young, their eyes still carrying the fresh sting of shattered dreams. **_"Messenger of Love, that is true,"_** one says, his voice heavy with a lifelong disappointment. **_"I also awakened no talent, and it was the most painful day of my life. I felt… worthless."_** Another adds, his voice filled with a question that has haunted him for years, **_"Why hasn't heaven given me a chance? That is something I have asked myself every single day since that fateful ceremony."_** A woman whispers, her eyes still haunted by the memory, **_"I cried for years. My dreams, my hopes for a better future… they all shattered the moment the results of the awakening ceremony were announced."_** Hearing their collective pain, the weight of their shared sorrow pressing down on him, a deep and profound sadness washes over Fang Yuan. He looks at Fang Ma again, his voice filled with a desperate concern. **_"Mama, isn't there any way to help them? Isn't there anything we can do?"_**

Fang Ma steps forward, her expression reassuring, her eyes filled with a knowing wisdom. **_"My love,"_** she says gently, her voice carrying a note of hope, **_"there is always a way. Never lose hope."_**

**_"What is it?"_** Fang Yuan asks eagerly, his eyes shining with a renewed sense of possibility.

**_"There are many rare herbs, precious treasures, potent elixirs, and even powerful martial parasites that can awaken one's talent or increase existing talent,"_** Fang Ma explains, her voice filled with confidence and a hint of the vast knowledge she holds. **_"If someone is truly determined, if their will is strong enough, even without any innate talent, they can surpass even the most naturally gifted individuals with the right resources and unwavering effort."_**

**_"Really?"_** Fang Yuan asks, his eyes wide with a mixture of disbelief and immense hope.

**_"Yes, my love,"_** Fang Ma confirms with a warm, loving smile. **_"Talent isn't the ultimate deciding factor. It is merely a starting point. With perseverance and the right opportunities, anyone can achieve greatness."_**

**_"Does that mean… she can also get a chance?"_** Fang Yuan asks, looking at the still-tearful girl in his arms, his voice filled with a newfound optimism.

**_"Yes,"_** Fang Ma says firmly, her gaze sweeping over the crowd of hopeful faces. **_"Everyone can get a chance."_**

Fang Yuan turns to the girl, his face beaming with happiness, his eyes filled with a genuine compassion that radiates outwards. **_"Don't cry,"_** he says, his voice filled with a newfound hope and determination. **_"You will also get a chance! We will make sure of it."_**

**_"Thank you, Messenger of Love,"_** she whispers, her voice thick with emotion, her eyes finally lifting to meet his, filled with a glimmer of light in the darkness.

Fang Yuan looks back at Fang Ma, his eyes shining with excitement and a burning desire to help. **_"Mama, why don't we give everyone a chance? Why don't we provide them with those herbs, treasures, elixirs, and martial parasites?"_**

Fang Ma nods thoughtfully. **_"Those resources are quite rare and valuable, but still manageable with our current wealth. If you truly wish it, my love, I can certainly make it an opportunity for everyone who desires it."_**

**_"Mama, how are we going to do that?"_** Fang Yuan asks, his mind already racing with possibilities, his heart filled with a sense of purpose. **_"What do you think about if we allow the talentless to also go to the academy? Or maybe even establish another academy specifically for them, where they can learn and grow despite their lack of initial talent?"_**

**_"Do it, Mama!"_** Fang Yuan exclaims, his voice filled with passionate enthusiasm. **_"We should definitely do it! Everyone deserves a chance to pursue their dreams!"_**

**_"If you say so, my love, I will do it,"_** Fang Ma replies, her eyes filled with an overwhelming love and admiration for her son’s boundless compassion.

Overwhelmed with joy and gratitude, Fang Yuan leaps forward and throws his arms around Fang Ma, hugging her tightly. **_"Mama, you are the best! You always know what to do!"_**

From behind him, Fang Sianer tugs gently on his clothes, her eyes filled with a hint of playful jealousy. **_"My love, give me a hug too!"_** Fang Yuan turns and embraces his sister, who hugs him back with equal affection, her smile radiant. **_"Everyone should get a chance, what do you say, My Sianer?"_** Fang Yuan asks, his voice filled with warmth. **_"Yes, my love,"_** Fang Sianer replies firmly, her agreement absolute, **_"everyone should get a chance!"_**

The crowd looks at Fang Yuan with newfound respect and profound admiration, their eyes filled with hope and gratitude, their hearts touched by his boundless kindness and his unwavering commitment to justice. And the girl who had awakened no talent looks at Fang Yuan with a loving gaze, her face now illuminated with a radiant hope, as if she has finally found her light in the overwhelming darkness.
