About seven days have passed since the awakening ceremony. Fang Yuan's condition remains as dire as ever. He lies on the bed, his body still now, but his eyes vacant, responding only purely based on instinct. Many Martial Elixirs, Martial Artifacts, and Martial Parasites, precious resources, have been used in attempts to help him, but his condition hasn't improved in the slightest.

Primarily, Fang Ma, Fang Sianer, and Yao Le are the ones tirelessly taking care of Fang Yuan. They sit by his bedside, their presence a constant vigil. News about Fang Yuan's condition hasn't reached the general public; Fang Ma has skillfully prevented it, maintaining a tight lid on the unsettling truth.

Deep, dark circles are visible under Fang Ma's eyes. She is truly worried, the fear for her son a constant weight on her heart, and she hasn't slept properly for a single day since that terrifying night in the cave. She is trying all possible ways to make Fang Yuan become normal again, to pull him back from the abyss he glimpsed. Since Martial Elixirs, Martial Artifacts, and Martial Parasites have proven ineffective in addressing the root of his problem, the abnormality of his martial core, she has been desperately trying to find other ways to understand what is happening within him, to find a way to make her Fang Yuan come back to her.

As Fang Ma is sitting beside Fang Yuan, looking at his still face, she cannot help but cry out, a soft, heartbroken sound. Fang Yuan's face, even in its stillness, looks deeply fearful, haunted by a horror she can only imagine. Fang Ma gently strokes Fang Yuan's face and hair with all the motherly love and affection that she possesses, her touch a desperate plea to reach him. She leans down and presses a kiss onto Fang Yuan's forehead. Suddenly, a thought, a desperate gamble, crosses her mind.

_"Fang Yuan's martial core and essence are a shadowy black,"_ she murmurs to herself, her voice thick with tears and determination. _"Which means it will likely only become more black, more terrifying, the more he ranks up. And usually, no one would ever inject their own primeval essence into someone else's martial core; it pollutes the core and essence, making it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to purify. But… but Fang Yuan's martial core and essence are already black. Why not inject my martial essence into his martial core? My pure, transparent white essence… Maybe… maybe there might be a miracle. Maybe it can counteract the blackness, or at least show me what is happening inside him."_

And so, she makes the decision. With a determined look on her face, despite the fear that trembles deep within her, she holds Fang Yuan's hand. She closes her eyes, concentrating all her will, and begins to channel her martial essence, her pure, transparent white energy, into Fang Yuan's body, through his hand, directing it towards his heart, towards that terrifying black core. As Fang Ma's martial essence begins channeling into Fang Yuan's body, a strange, unsettling sensation washes over her. _"I have never felt this much closeness to my son!"_ she ponders, her mind struggling to process the feeling. _"It feels as if we have become one… and it might be because his body, his core, is accepting my essence. Oh, my love! Don't worry! Mama will find out ways to help you! I will understand this darkness!"_

But the connection is short-lived. After a moment that feels like an eternity, Fang Ma’s eyes snap open in fear. She recoils violently, jumping backward from the bed, her face pale, her body panting heavily. Fear is eminent in her eyes, a raw terror that mirrors the look she saw on Fang Yuan's face in the cave. _"What was that?"_ she thinks, her mind reeling from the sensation. _"As soon as my martial essence went near Fang Yuan's martial core, I felt… I felt like I was being devoured alive! And what was this feeling? So terrifying… so utterly chilling. I have really underestimated Fang Yuan's martial core. Before, other elders and I just tried to _see_ his martial core and essence, observing it from a distance. But now that I have gotten closer, made a direct connection… it feels truly terrifying. Like a void… a hungry void."_

Fang Sianer and Yao Le, who had just come out after taking a bath, their hair damp, their faces clean, their worry still present, see Fang Ma’s terrified reaction. Fang Sianer rushes forward, her voice filled with concern. _"Mother, is there anything wrong? What happened?"_ Yao Le also asks, her voice trembling slightly, _"Aunt Fang Ma, is there anything wrong? Why do you look so scared?"_ Fang Ma responds quickly, trying to act normal, forcing a strained smile onto her face. _"No! Nothing wrong, my dears! Just… felt a little dizzy. Have you two taken your bath properly? Are you clean?"_ They respond, their voices filled with concern, _"Yes! We are clean! But Mama/Aunt Fang Ma, you look… you look very scared!"_

Another week passes by, a blur of tireless care and mounting despair. Fang Yuan's condition is still the same, with no improvement. He remains lost within himself, responding only instinctively. During these seven days, all the medicine hall elders, along with Yao Ji, the leader, have tried their methods, their elixirs, their artifacts, but nothing has worked. And even more, when treating Fang Yuan, they all maintain a strict caution, a visible fear in their eyes. Some of them, after attempting to investigate his martial core, have not even come back to the room to treat him, haunted by the fear they felt trying to check Fang Yuan's terrifying black core.

Despite the fact that Fang Ma has faced this terrifying fear, the chilling sensation of her martial essence being devoured by Fang Yuan's martial core, she has tried every day, multiple times, to channel her essence into him, to understand the darkness within him. Each attempt is met with the same horror, the same chilling feeling of being consumed, but she persists, driven by a mother's desperate love.

Again, Fang Ma jumps backward from the bed, her face a mask of horrified terror, panting heavily. Her condition has become worse day after day. She looks almost like a zombie now, the fear a permanent resident on her face, etching itself into her features, draining her of her life force.

Fang Sianer, seeing her mother's worsening state, cries out, her voice filled with anguish and desperation. _"Mama, please stop! What is going on? Why are you doing this to yourself?"_

Yao Le also says, her voice filled with pleading, _"Yes, Aunt Fang Ma, please stop now! Today, within just a few hours, you have tried multiple times, and every time you are more fearful and terrified than the last!"_

Fang Sianer, her voice thick with tears, shouts, _"Mama, what actually are you doing? You are saying that you are trying to make brother come back, to make him normal, but why aren't you trying to let _me_ do it? I want to help brother!"_

Fang Ma, her voice strained but firm, filled with a protective fear, says, _"It is very dangerous, my love. What I am doing… trying to understand his core… it is very dangerous. I think you already know how dangerous it is from seeing the other elders, even the leader's terrified and traumatized faces after they tried to check him."_

Fang Sianer, her eyes filled with a fierce determination that mirrors her mother's, asks, _"Then why are _you_ doing this? If it's so dangerous, why are you putting yourself in harm's way?"_

Fang Ma responds, her voice filled with a desperate hope that fuels her actions. _"I think… I think if I can understand Fang Yuan's martial core, if I can find a way to connect with it, to reach inside it… I will be able to understand what is happening to him. I will be able to make our Fang Yuan come back to us."_

Yao Le, her face pale, suggests, _"Then why are you not letting us do it? Maybe… maybe if we all try together, it would be faster. Maybe our combined essence could help."_

Fang Ma responds strongly, her voice filled with a protective absolute refusal. _"No! Absolutely not! I cannot allow that! Can't you see how dangerous it is? The fear I feel… the way my essence is devoured… I cannot let you experience that! It is too dangerous!"_

Fang Sianer, her voice filled with pleading, with a fierce love for her brother, cries out, _"Mama, please! I will be alright! I have a high talent too! Please… please let me try just one time! Let me try to help my love!"_

Fang Ma responds with an unyielding, absolute authority, her voice ringing with a finality that silences all arguments. _"No! Mean No! I have made my decision! This is too dangerous for you! If you don't obey my command, if you insist on trying to do this, I will sent you both away… to Yao Le's grandmother's house. You will stay there until Fang Yuan is well. Do you understand?"_ Her voice is firm, her resolve unbreakable, driven by a mother's desperate, protective love.
