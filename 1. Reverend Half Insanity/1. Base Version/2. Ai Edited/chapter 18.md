It is afternoon, the sun casting long shadows across the backyard as Fang Ma watches over her children at play. Her gaze drifts towards Fang Fu's grave, a simple mound of earth that holds the memory of her sacrifice. Unbidden, tears well up in her eyes and spill down her cheeks. Fang Zheng and Fang Sianer, in their innocent world, do not yet grasp the profound meaning of death, but Fang Yuan, even at his young age, understands that it signifies a journey to a place so far away that they can never meet again.

Seeing the tears on his mother's face, Fang Yuan abandons his play with Fang Sianer and rushes to Fang Ma's side, his small face etched with concern. _"Mother, you always cry when you look at Father's tomb,"_ he says, his voice filled with a child's earnest desire to comfort. _"Haven't I told you? One day, I will become a martial god, and I will revive Father, and you will be able to meet him again. So, don't cry, Mama."_

Fang Ma, a stranger in this world, doesn't truly understand her own tears for a man she never knew in life. Yet, the depth of the original Fang Ma's love resonates within her. She quickly pulls Fang Yuan into a tight embrace, burying her face in his soft hair. _"Oh, my boy!"_ she whispers, her voice thick with emotion. _"One day, you definitely will. Your mother knows that you are destined for greatness. My love, never forget your mother's love and teachings, no matter how bad things become."_

Fang Yuan looks up into Fang Ma's tear-filled eyes, his small hands reaching up to gently wipe away her tears. _"Mother, don't worry,"_ he says, his voice filled with a fierce protectiveness beyond his years. _"I will never forget. Mama, I will protect..."_

Before Fang Yuan can finish his sentence, a voice booms from behind them, jovial and overly enthusiastic. _"How is everything going on!"_ Dong Tu strides towards them, a wide, forced smile on his face. _"Look, Fang Yuan, Fang Zheng, and Fang Sianer! See what your uncle has brought for you this time!"_

Dong Tu moves forward, placing a colorful array of toys and a generous pile of sweet candies before Fang Zheng and Fang Sianer. Their faces light up with delight as they eagerly reach for the treats and begin to play with their new treasures.

He then turns his attention to Fang Ma, who stands nearby, still holding Fang Yuan protectively in her arms. _"They all have grown up so quickly,"_ he remarks, his gaze lingering on Fang Ma for a moment longer than necessary.

He reaches out to take Fang Sianer into his arms, but Fang Yuan instantly stiffens, his small voice sharp with possessiveness. _"Don't touch my sister."_

Dong Tu's forced smile falters for a fraction of a second before returning, slightly strained. He instead scoops up a giggling Fang Zheng into his arms, his mind working furiously. _"This little brat is really troublesome,"_ he thinks, a flicker of annoyance in his eyes. _"He doesn't even let me come close to his mother or his sister. But, he is truly extraordinary, the way he extorted the Clan Leader on the welcoming ceremony day. I have to be very patient. The more difficult it is to obtain, the more rewarding it will be."_

Dong Tu moves closer to Fang Ma, holding Fang Zheng in his arms. _"Things must be really tiring for you, aren't they?"_ he says, his voice dripping with false concern. _"Taking care of these children all alone."_

Fang Ma offers a polite, albeit strained, smile. _"How can this be tiring?"_ she responds, her voice calm but firm. _"They are my children, and I would gladly give my life for them. This is not tiring; rather, they are my warmth, my everything."_

Dong Tu chuckles, his eyes still fixed on Fang Ma. _"I didn't mean it that way. I have prepared a helper for you who will ease your burden."_

Fang Ma's smile doesn't reach her eyes. _"I don't need any helper,"_ she replies, her tone leaving no room for argument. _"I can manage perfectly well myself. I want to spend as much time with my children as possible."_

Ignoring her protest, Dong Tu calls out loudly, _"Mother Shen, come here quickly!"_

A middle-aged woman rushes out from the side of the mansion, her movements quick and efficient. She holds a baby in her arms, her expression respectful. _"Yes, Master Dong Tu!"_

_"From today onward,"_ Dong Tu declares, his voice authoritative, _"you will stay by Madam Fang Ma's side and help her in every way possible. Do you understand?"_

Mother Shen bows her head. _"Yes, Master. I will."_

_"Let your girl, Shen Cui, play with them,"_ Dong Tu continues, gesturing towards Fang Sianer and Fang Zheng. _"They will be happy to have a new playmate."_


Mother Shen gently puts down her daughter, Shen Cui, near Fang Sianer. Fang Sianer look pretty small compare to Shen Cui despite the fact that she is one year younger that Fang Sianer. Shen Cui, oblivious to the subtle power dynamics, immediately reaches out to play with Fang Sianer. Dong Tu also places Fang Zheng near Shen Cui, patting his head. _"Look! A new playmate! Say hi."_

After a few moments, Fang Zheng, Shen Cui, and Fang Sianer are playing together, their innocent laughter filling the air. Dong Tu turns back to Fang Ma, a smug look on his face. _"Haven't I told you that this will ease your burden? I have told you before that you don't have to bear all this alone. I am always here, ready to help you."_

_"Thank you for your consideration,"_ Fang Ma responds politely, but her face remains pale, a subtle tension in her posture.

Fang Ma feels an instinctive discomfort around men, a deep-seated aversion that makes even casual conversation a challenge. When it comes to Dong Tu and Gu Yue Bo, this discomfort intensifies, a primal unease that settles deep within her.

Yet, she doesn't directly chase them away. The harsh reality is that she is now a powerless mortal, unable to protect her children from their schemes. Despite her lack of control over the mansion and its finances, Dong Tu does provide Fang Ma with a portion of the profits generated from her inherited assets. His reasoning is strategic: Gu Yue Bo, wielding his authority as Clan Leader, has been subtly probing for any weaknesses or missteps by Dong Tu. Having caught wind of Gu Yue Bo's actions, Dong Tu shrewdly began sharing the profits with Fang Ma. Knowing that Gu Yue Bo also desires Fang Ma for himself, he hasn't dared to openly attack Dong Tu's business dealings, effectively providing Dong Tu with a shield against the Clan Leader's machinations. Dong Tu is outwardly showing a degree of deference to Gu Yue Bo while cleverly using Fang Ma as a buffer.

Fang Ma understands this intricate dance of power perfectly. Beneath her seemingly weak and pathetic exterior, she is subtly manipulating both Dong Tu and Gu Yue Bo, using one to check and balance the other. She avoids prolonged conversations, but when she senses their hope waning, she offers simple, carefully chosen words. _"You are truly kind,"_ she might say, her voice soft and seemingly grateful. _"I don't know how I would have managed this far without your help."_

These simple lines act like fuel to their desires, reinforcing their belief that they are on the verge of success, that just a little more kindness and patience will eventually lead to her surrender.

A fierce determination burns within Fang Ma. She is prepared to make her hands dirty, to embrace the shadows, if it means securing a bright future for her children and shielding them from the darkness that looms. Morality, as she once knew it, has become fluid. Now, her only guiding principle is the safety and well-being of her children. Anything that ensures their future and protects them from harm is right; everything else is insignificant. And for that sacred purpose, if absolutely necessary, she is even ready to sacrifice herself, and even sell herself off if it comes to that.
