Then, the elderâ€™s voice rings out, clear and resonant, filling the underground cave. _"Fang Yuan!"_

A wave of anticipation sweeps through the gathered youths and the observing elders. Everyone looks at Fang Yuan with hope and admiration, their eyes sparkling with anticipation. They expect him to be an A-grade talent, perhaps even surpassing Fang Zheng's achievement. It is surprising, even touching, that those who awakened no talent are silently praying for Fang Yuan to awaken the highest talent possible, their hopes for his future intertwined with their gratitude for his past kindness. Thanks to Fang Ma's unwavering efforts and Fang Yuan's own compassionate nature, he has become an undisputed, respected figure in everyone's eyes.

_"Brother, it is your turn!"_ Fang Sianer says, her voice filled with excitement and pride as she looks at him. _"Brother Fang Yuan, you will do wonderfully!"_ Fang Zheng nods in agreement, a supportive smile on his face.

Even though everyone's eyes are sparkling with the expectation of a high talent, Fang Ma, sitting at the elders' table, looks very pale. Worries are clearly visible in her eyes, a stark contrast to the hopeful faces around her. The anxiety she felt the previous night, after Fang Yuan heard the terrifying voice, is now even more pronounced, etched onto her features. She fears that anything could go wrong in this crucial moment.

Then, Fang Yuan takes a deep breath, a bright smile gracing his lips. He looks at everyone around him who are praising him, giving him good luck, their faces filled with admiration. His gaze then seeks out Fang Ma, his mother, at the elders' table, searching for her last acknowledgement and good wish. But when he sees Fang Ma's face from a distance, even though there is quite a space between them, he can sense the deep worry etched on her features. His smile vanishes instantly, replaced by a look of concern. Seeing his worry, Fang Ma quickly forces a gentle smile, trying to reassure him. Fang Yuan, seeing his mother's smile, doesn't dwell on her earlier expression. He smiles back at Fang Ma, a silent message passing between them, as if assuring her not to worry, everything will be alright.

With that bright smile, carrying the weight of his mother's unspoken fear and the crowd's immense hope, he takes his first step into the river of flowers.

The cool water touches his skin, and in that instant, the world around him seems to fade. He feels a profound shift within him, not the expected pressure of the awakening, but something else entirely. He feels that someone, or something, within him is trying to forcefully take control, to inject foreign memories into his mind, to overwhelm his very being. He feels that even though outwardly he is standing in the river, seemingly calm and composed, battling an unseen enemy, fighting hard, fighting to the death to prevent that entity from seizing control, and he is winning, pushing back against the invasive force.

He takes more steps in the flower river, his body moving almost automatically, but he is totally unaware of the ground beneath his feet, unaware of the steps he is taking. His entire focus is on the battle raging within him. He feels like he is fighting with some powerful, ancient, demonic entity hidden deep within his soul. Even though he has only taken a few steps in the physical world, the fight within feels like an eternity, a timeless struggle for control of his own self.

Then, amidst the internal struggle, he feels something break within him, a barrier crumbling. But strangely, he doesn't feel pain or loss. Instead, it is a feeling of profound release, as if a part of him was sealed away, and now that seal has been broken, that part has been released. He feels suddenly complete, whole, as if he was incomplete, fragmented, before this moment.

And as the seal breaks, as this hidden part of him is released, he begins to see memories. Memories that were sealed away, locked behind an invisible door. They flash before his eyes, a torrent of images and sensations, flooding his mind with experiences that are both familiar and utterly foreign. He is seeing the memories that were sealed, memories of another life, another time, another self.
