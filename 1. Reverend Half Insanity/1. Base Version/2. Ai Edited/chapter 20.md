It is afternoon, and the sun bathes the courtyard in a warm glow. Fang Ma watches over her children as they play, a serene smile gracing her lips. She had run with them earlier, her laughter mingling with theirs. Even though her martial core is gone, the residual power within her body keeps her energy levels high. She sits now, allowing them to enjoy their own games, knowing her presence often draws their attention solely to her. She has already filled their morning with playful adventures.

Behind Fang Ma, Mother Shen stands silently, ever watchful. Over the past few years, Fang Ma has woven a subtle web of influence around Mother Shen, a quiet manipulation achieved without direct confrontation. Now, Mother Shen’s loyalty to Fang Ma is absolute, a subconscious devotion so strong that she would choose Fang Ma over Dong Tu without a moment's hesitation.

The reason is simple yet profound. Fang Ma always treats Mother Shen with gentle kindness, often feigning a vulnerability that resonates deeply with the older woman. People only show their weaknesses to those they trust, and Mother Shen has subconsciously come to see Fang Ma as someone she needs to protect. To further solidify this bond, Fang Ma treats Shen Cui, Mother Shen’s daughter, with exceptional care, allowing her to eat with her own children and even gifting her Fang Sianer’s outgrown dresses. She has even shared quiet moments with Mother Shen, speaking of their shared experience of losing their husbands, forging an unspoken understanding that has cemented Mother Shen’s unwavering loyalty, a loyalty that would extend to sacrificing herself if the need arose.

And just like Mother Shen, Fang Ma has, through various subtle acts of kindness and carefully crafted words, turned all the servants in the mansion, both old and new, into devoted followers, their loyalty so strong they would gladly lay down their lives for her.

When she first arrived in this world, trapped within Fang Ma’s body, a wave of despair washed over her, quickly followed by a fierce acceptance as she gazed upon the innocent faces of her children. At that moment, she was powerless, at the mercy of everyone around her.

But now, the situation has been completely reversed. Dong Tu and even the Clan Leader have become her unwitting pawns. Sometimes, all it takes is a carefully displayed moment of weakness, followed by a heartfelt expression of gratitude for their kindness, a subtle suggestion that she might not have survived without their help. And then, she simply allows their own desires to guide their actions.

When Dong Mi attempts to make her life difficult, Fang Ma merely needs to drop a few carefully chosen words within earshot of Mother Shen. The loyal servant then carries the information back to Dong Tu, her subconscious bias coloring the report in a way that portrays Fang Ma as being on the verge of collapse. The ever-eager Dong Tu, desperate to prove his worth, invariably reacts with swift and decisive action against his own wife.

Under the guise of playing with her children, Fang Ma has made it a point to interact with every servant in the mansion, even the newest arrivals. With a few gentle words and thoughtful gestures, she has swiftly, and without their conscious awareness, secured their unwavering loyalty.

The entire mansion is now under her subtle but firm control. It has taken her four years of careful planning and execution to achieve this. Every move she makes is calculated, precise. Her next mission: to seize control of all the financial sectors and amass a substantial fortune and valuable resources before Fang Yuan reaches the age of fifteen. She knows his martial talent is lacking, and to compensate for this deficiency, he will require an immense amount of support.

Her target for the next eight years is clear: to gain complete control of the finances, expand their wealth, and gather an overwhelming abundance of money, precious resources, rare items, and potent elixirs to aid Fang Yuan’s martial cultivation, ensuring he never feels inferior, but rather, utterly empowered.

On the other side of the courtyard, Fang Yuan ran ahead, laughter spilling from his lips as he glanced over his shoulder. "Little Sianer, catch me if you can!"

Fang Sianer, her small frame filled with determination, was right on his heels. Meanwhile, Fang Zheng was focused on his own creation, stacking mud and stones into miniature structures. Beside him, Shen Cui watched with wide-eyed wonder.

Then, suddenly, a cry broke through the laughter.

"Brother! My love! Wait—look! Blood!"

Fang Yuan skidded to a halt, his heart lurching in panic. He spun around to see Fang Sianer standing still, gripping her clothing tightly, her eyes brimming with tears.

"What happened?" he asked, voice sharp with worry.

She lifted her foot slightly, revealing fresh red streaks trailing down her legs. "Brother, love, look! There’s blood! More and more blood!"

A sharp bolt of fear shot through Fang Yuan. "Mama! Quickly! Come here!" His voice cracked with urgency.

Fang Ma’s heart clenched at his desperate cry. Without thinking, she rushed toward them, her pulse hammering in her chest.

She found Fang Yuan holding Fang Sianer in a tight embrace, both of them crying. Fang Yuan’s voice trembled as he repeated, "Don’t be afraid. Don’t be afraid."

Fang Ma knelt beside them and examined Fang Sianer carefully. She traced the source of the blood, her keen eyes assessing the situation. Then, after a moment, she exhaled slowly, relief flooding through her.

"Don’t worry, my dear," she said gently, brushing Fang Sianer’s hair back. "Everything is fine. This is natural for a growing girl."

Fang Yuan blinked, confusion battling his fear. "It’s… normal?"

Fang Ma smiled, wiping Fang Sianer’s tears away. "Yes, it is a sign that she is growing up. Nothing to fear."

Fang Yuan hesitated, then nodded, still holding his sister close.

Fang Ma looked at them, her heart swelling. This was her world now. And she would do whatever it took to protect it.

Fang Ma gently cupped Fang Sianer’s tear-streaked face, her touch warm and reassuring. "My dear, there’s nothing to be afraid of," she said softly. "This just means you’re growing into a strong young lady—just like Mama."

Fang Sianer sniffled, still clinging to Fang Yuan. "But… it hurts, Mama."

Fang Ma smiled, brushing Sianer’s hair back. "I know, little one. But just like when you scraped your knee while learning to walk, the pain won’t last. Your body is changing, becoming stronger. It’s something every girl goes through."

Fang Yuan, still holding his sister protectively, furrowed his brows. His curious mind was already working. "But Mama, why doesn’t it happen to me?"

Fang Ma chuckled, ruffling his hair. "Because boys and girls are different, my little scholar. Your sister’s body is preparing her to be even stronger in her own way."

Fang Yuan frowned, still not fully satisfied. "But how? Why does Sianer’s body change, but mine doesn’t?"

Fang Ma’s smile deepened as she pointed to Fang Sianer. "Do you remember when your sister was just a baby? She couldn’t even crawl, let alone walk. But she kept trying, even though she sometimes fell and got hurt."

Fang Yuan nodded slowly. "Yes… she cried a lot back then."

Fang Ma laughed. "Exactly! And now look at her—running, playing, almost catching up to you! That’s because her body got stronger little by little. This is the same. It’s just another step in her journey of growing up."

Fang Yuan looked at his sister, studying her closely. His intelligent eyes flickered with understanding, and finally, he nodded. "So… it’s like training?"

Fang Ma smiled. "Yes, in a way. Her body is training itself to be strong in a different way from yours."

Fang Yuan pursed his lips, deep in thought, then finally let out a breath. "Alright… but Mama, if Sianer ever feels pain again, I’ll protect her!"

Fang Sianer, still sniffling, turned to her brother with wide eyes. Then, slowly, a small smile crept onto her face. She reached out and hugged him tightly. "Thank you, Brother… I love you."

Fang Yuan puffed out his chest. "Of course! I love you too, Little Sianer!"

Fang Ma watched them, warmth blooming in her heart. These children… they were her everything. And she would make sure they had all the strength they needed to face the world.

Fang Ma gently wiped away the last of Fang Sianer’s tears and lifted her into her arms. "Come, my dear, let’s get you cleaned up," she said softly, pressing a reassuring kiss to her forehead.

Fang Sianer nodded, still clinging to her mother, her little hands grasping the fabric of Fang Ma’s robe. Though the fear had not completely faded, her trust in her mother made her feel safe.

Just as Fang Ma turned to leave, Fang Yuan hurried after them, his small footsteps pattering against the ground. "I’m coming too!" he announced.

Fang Ma glanced over her shoulder, amusement flickering in her eyes. "Hmm? And why do you need to come, my little scholar?"

Fang Yuan puffed up his chest. "Because Sianer might still be scared! If I stay with her, she’ll feel better!"

Fang Ma chuckled and shook her head. "My dear Yuan, this is something for girls. Your sister needs some time with Mama right now."

Fang Yuan frowned, obviously dissatisfied. "But I always stay with Sianer! We do everything together!"

Fang Ma’s expression softened. "I know, my love. And she’s lucky to have such a caring brother. But just like how you have your training and lessons, there are some things only girls need to learn. This is one of them."

Fang Yuan crossed his arms, deep in thought. Then, after a moment, he sighed dramatically. "Alright… but Mama, tell her that if she needs anything, I’ll be right here!"

Fang Ma laughed softly. "I will, I promise, my love."

Fang Sianer peeked over Fang Ma’s shoulder and gave her brother a tiny smile. "Thank you, Brother. I’ll be back soon!"

Satisfied, Fang Yuan stood tall and waved. "Okay! But hurry, so we can play again!"

Fang Ma carried Fang Sianer inside, her heart filled with warmth. These children… they were her world, and she would protect them with everything she had.
