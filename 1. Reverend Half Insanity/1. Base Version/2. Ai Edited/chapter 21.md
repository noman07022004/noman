Four more years flit by, marked by the gentle rhythm of seasons and the steady growth of children. Fang Yuan is now eleven, his sharp eyes reflecting an ever-increasing understanding of the world around him. Fang Zheng, a boisterous ten and a half, embodies the boundless energy of a typical child his age. And finally, after all these quiet years, Fang Sianer, now a bright-eyed ten-year-old, blossoms into the world of simple conversation, her voice a sweet melody in the household.

This afternoon, a palpable excitement fills the air. Fang Ma, her eyes sparkling with affection, presents each of her children with beautiful, new dresses. The fabrics are rich and vibrant, the designs carefully chosen to suit their individual personalities. After a moment of admiring their gifts, Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng excuse themselves and head to another room to change, eager to don their new attire.

Fang Ma turns her attention to Fang Sianer, who stands patiently beside Mother Shen. _"Let's get you ready, my little angel,"_ she says, her voice soft with love. She gestures to Mother Shen. _"Mother Shen, could you help Shen Cui get dressed as well?"_ Mother Shen nods, a warm smile gracing her lips as she begins to assist her daughter.

Fang Ma carefully helps Fang Sianer slip into her gorgeous new dress. The fabric flows around her like liquid moonlight, and the delicate embroidery catches the light with every movement. When she is finally dressed, Fang Sianer looks like an angel descended from the heavens, her innocent beauty radiating through the room. Overwhelmed with love, Fang Ma showers Fang Sianer with kisses and pulls her into a tight embrace. _"Oh, my sweet girl,"_ she murmurs, her heart overflowing with affection.

Just then, Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng return to the room, looking smart and handsome in their new clothes. Fang Zheng’s eyes immediately light up as he spots Shen Cui, who also looks lovely in her new dress. A shy gaze passes between them, and a faint blush rises on their cheeks.

Fang Zheng, unable to contain his admiration, stammers out, _"Shen Cui, your dress… it looks very beautiful."_ Shen Cui, equally shy, returns the compliment, her voice barely a whisper. _"Young Master Zheng, you look very handsome too."_ Fang Ma watches them with a knowing smile. _"You both look wonderful,"_ she interjects gently, her heart warmed by their innocent interaction.

Mother Shen beams, her eyes filled with a hopeful joy. Fang Zheng’s obvious affection for her daughter fills her with a sense of relief and anticipation. Perhaps, in the future, Shen Cui will not have to live a life of servitude like her. She has naturally gravitated towards Fang Zheng, her care for him exceeding that of the other young masters. Initially hesitant to show favoritism, a casual comment from Fang Ma some time ago had emboldened her. She remembers the day clearly: Fang Zheng and Shen Cui were playing together at a distance, their laughter carrying on the breeze. Fang Ma had turned to her, a soft smile on her face, and remarked, _"It looks like they really like each other."_ Mother Shen’s heart had skipped a beat with a mix of fear and hope. But Fang Ma’s next sentence had shattered her fear, replacing it with a surge of joyful anticipation. _"They will be a good combination in the future."_ From that day forward, Mother Shen’s obedience and loyalty to Fang Ma had reached a new level, and she had begun to treat Fang Zheng with extra care, almost as if he were her future son-in-law. While she had tried to extend the same warmth to Fang Yuan and Fang Sianer, they hadn’t shown much interest in her attention. Fang Zheng, however, happily accepted her compliments, finding a special delight in her praise, even more so than Fang Ma’s. Mother Shen’s compliments often took the form of, _"Young Master Zheng, you are truly remarkable. Shen Cui can learn so much from you."_ These words, subtly elevating Fang Zheng in Shen Cui’s eyes, always brought a shy blush to his cheeks, but he clearly enjoyed the attention. Now, dressed in his new clothes, Fang Zheng makes his way towards Shen Cui and her mother, eager to receive their compliments and to showcase his handsome appearance.

Fang Yuan, his gaze drawn to Fang Sianer, stares at her in genuine admiration. Her new dress transforms her into an ethereal being, her beauty almost otherworldly. Fang Sianer, noticing his gaze, twirls slightly, a hopeful look in her eyes. _"My love,"_ she says, her voice sweet and innocent, _"look at me and tell me how I look."_ Fang Yuan’s eyes widen in astonishment. _"My Sianer,"_ he breathes out, his voice filled with genuine wonder, _"you look truly beautiful. Just like an angel."_ Fang Sianer laughs lightly, a delicate sound like the tinkling of bells. _"Mother also told me that,"_ she says, her cheeks flushed with pleasure. Fang Yuan then turns his attention to Fang Ma, who also looks stunning in her elegant attire. _"Mama,"_ he says, his eyes filled with affection, _"you look so beautiful. You two are like two angels. Very, very beautiful."_ Hearing his heartfelt compliment, Fang Ma’s laughter rings out, warm and joyful. She pulls Fang Yuan into a tight hug, showering him with kisses. _"Oh, my love,"_ she murmurs, her voice filled with tenderness, _"you are such a gentle boy. Mama is so, so happy."_

And then they head towards the bustling market. As they walk along the crowded road, all eyes turn towards them, a silent acknowledgment of their striking presence. The group naturally separates into two distinct pairs as they move through the throng. Fang Yuan and Fang Sianer walk hand-in-hand just ahead of Fang Ma, their youthful energy palpable. Slightly behind them, Fang Zheng and Shen Cui also hold hands, their shy smiles reflecting a budding affection, walking just before Mother Shen, who keeps a watchful eye on them while walking alongside Fang Ma.

Soon, they enter the vibrant festival area, a kaleidoscope of sights, sounds, and smells. The air is thick with the aroma of delicious street food, stalls display beautiful dresses and glittering jewelry, and performers captivate the crowds with dazzling displays of dancing, acrobatic circus acts, mesmerizing magic shows, and much more.

In an instant, Fang Sianer’s attention is caught by the colorful array of food stalls, her eyes wide with longing. With a joyful tug on Fang Yuan’s hand, she rushes forward, her brother keeping pace beside her. At the same moment, Fang Zheng and Shen Cui are mesmerized by the flashing lights and intriguing illusions of a nearby magic show. Their hands still clasped, they eagerly move towards the opposite direction. Fang Ma quickly instructs Mother Shen, _"Please follow Fang Zheng and Shen Cui. I will stay with Fang Yuan and Fang Sianer."_ Mother Shen nods and gently guides the two younger children towards the magic show, while Fang Ma keeps a close watch on Fang Yuan and Fang Sianer.

As they navigate the crowded pathways, Fang Sianer, her gaze fixed on a tantalizing skewer of candied fruit, accidentally bumps into another girl, and they both tumble to the ground in a flurry of limbs and surprised cries. The girl is Yao Le, who has come to the festival with Yao Ji, the current leader of the medicine hall.

Fang Yuan immediately turns his attention to Fang Sianer, his brow furrowed with concern. _"Sianer! Are you hurt?"_ he asks, quickly helping her to her feet. She giggles, shaking her head. _"I'm okay, brother!"_ Relieved, Fang Yuan turns to the other girl, his expression apologetic. _"I am so sorry,"_ he says to Yao Ji, who is already helping Yao Le up. But as he looks at the girl's face, a flicker of recognition sparks in his eyes. _"Yao Le!"_ he exclaims, a slight pause before adding with genuine concern, _"Are you hurt?"_ Without waiting for a response, he kneels down to examine her legs, his gaze focused on her knee. Yao Le’s cheeks flush a delicate pink as Fang Yuan spots a small scrape on her knee. Without hesitation, Fang Yuan raises his hand to his mouth, then gently uses his spit to clean the small wound.

Just then, Fang Ma comes forward, her expression a mixture of concern and gentle authority as she checks on both Fang Sianer and Yao Le. Yao Ji, the grandmother of Yao Le and the current medicine hall leader, also approaches, her brow furrowed with worry. Upon seeing Fang Ma, Yao Ji’s eyes widen slightly, and she greets her with genuine respect. _"Elder Fang Ma! How are you!"_ Her tone carries the deference of a former assistant, a habit ingrained from years of serving under Fang Ma. She had only risen to her current position after Fang Ma’s martial power had vanished.

_"I am well, Yao Ji,"_ Fang Ma replies with a warm smile. _"But please, you don't need to call me that anymore. I am no longer the medicine hall leader; that is your role now."_

_"No! How can I?"_ Yao Ji insists, her voice filled with sincerity. While Fang Ma may now be a mortal without any martial power, Yao Ji would never dream of showing her disrespect. There is an undeniable undercurrent of power shifting within the village, a subtle tension that even the Clan Leader cannot ignore, and at the heart of it is the quiet rise of a new force. Over the past four years, Fang Ma has taken complete control of all financial sectors, reorganizing them with innovative methods gleaned from her past life. Using this modern approach, she now conducts extensive and highly profitable business throughout the village. She has even hired numerous Rank 1 and Rank 2 martial masters for security and to manage her burgeoning enterprises. Dong Tu is now a distant memory, his influence completely eclipsed, and Fang Ma continues to subtly guide the Clan Leader and other powerful elders with a delicate yet firm hand. One of these influential figures is Yao Ji herself. Fang Ma frequently visits the medicine hall with her children, using these opportunities to teach them the importance of kindness and compassion, often encouraging them to donate money to those who cannot afford medicine and treatment. In this often-harsh world, Fang Ma has cultivated an image of a benevolent angel, a kind soul who has descended to bring warmth and generosity to the earth. She has even earned the affectionate title, the **Mother of Kindness**, and is widely revered among the mortal villagers. Her motives for this carefully constructed persona are multifaceted. Firstly, it provides a layer of protection for her and her children. Secondly, it helps her recruit loyal servants and even martial masters who are drawn to her compassionate nature. But her most significant objective is to instill kindness, love, compassion, and other positive emotions as deeply as possible within Fang Yuan, hoping to steer him away from the path of cruelty that awaits him in the future. Furthermore, the clan, while often ruthless beneath the surface, outwardly values relationships and morality. As the widow of Fang Fu, who sacrificed his life for the clan, Fang Ma is virtually untouchable, shielded by a layer of respect and sympathy.


_"Sorry,"_ Fang Sianer says, her voice filled with genuine remorse, her big eyes looking at Yao Le with concern. _"I really didn't want to hurt you!"_

Yao Le, still blushing slightly, shakes her head. _"You don't have to apologize. It was also my fault; I was rushing towards the sweets stall."_

Fang Yuan, ever the attentive brother, again examines Yao Le’s knee, his brow furrowed in concentration. _"Look,"_ he says, pointing at the now barely visible scrape, _"the wound has completely healed! Your grandma is really awesome!"_

Yao Le responds, her heart fluttering in her chest, her voice barely above a whisper. _"Thank you for your kind words."_

_"Will you become a healer just like your grandmother?"_ Fang Yuan asks, his eyes bright with curiosity.

_"Yes!"_ Yao Le replies, her voice filled with newfound confidence.

_"Ha ha ha!"_ Fang Yuan laughs, a mischievous glint in his eyes. _"Then if I ever get injured, I will come to you to heal me! He he he, and I won't pay you! He he he!"_

Hearing his playful teasing, Yao Le starts to laugh, but it's a strange, breathless sound, as if she isn't quite sure what she's doing. Her thoughts seem to have momentarily deserted her, and her heart continues its rapid, excited rhythm.

Then, Fang Yuan turns to Fang Ma, a thoughtful expression on his face. _"Mama, weren't you also a healer?"_

_"Yes, my love!"_ Fang Ma replies, her voice warm and affectionate.

Turning back to Fang Sianer, Fang Yuan’s eyes light up with an idea. _"My Sianer, how about you become a healer too! That way, you can heal me and also help all who get injured!"_

Fang Sianer giggles, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. _"Okay, my love,"_ she says cheerfully, _"I will become a healer, and the best healer in the world! And I will heal everyone!"_

Suddenly, the sight of the nearby food stalls seems to ignite a spark of irresistible hunger in Fang Yuan. He grabs Fang Sianer’s hand with one of his and Yao Le’s hand with the other, his eyes shining with excitement. _"Let's go eat all the delicious food here!"_ he exclaims, pulling them along.

Yao Le’s condition seems to worsen with each step, her face now completely flushed a deep red. Her heart pounds in her chest like a frantic drum as Fang Yuan pulls her along, his hand warm around hers.

Fang Ma and Yao Ji follow behind them, their voices a low murmur as they converse, a knowing amusement in their eyes as they observe the children.

They reach a stall laden with colorful skewers of candied fruit. Fang Yuan buys one for each of them. As they eat, Fang Yuan points to his half-eaten skewer and then to Fang Sianer’s, which is almost finished. _"Sianer, you ate more than me!"_

Fang Sianer looks at their skewers, then back at Fang Yuan, a confused expression on her face. _"But, my love, you started eating first!"_

Yao Le, watching the exchange with a gentle smile, explains patiently, _"Sianer, even if he started first, if your skewer was longer, you would still eat more even if you ate at the same speed."_

Fang Sianer looks at the skewers again, then at Yao Le, her brow furrowed in thought. After a moment, her eyes widen in understanding. _"Oh! I get it now! It's about how big it is, not who started first!"_

Fang Yuan, having watched Yao Le’s patient explanation, turns to her, a genuine smile on his face. _"Yao Le, you are really smart! You explained that so well that even my Sianer understood it!"_ Yao Le’s face instantly flushes a deeper shade of red, her heart skipping a beat at his unexpected compliment.
