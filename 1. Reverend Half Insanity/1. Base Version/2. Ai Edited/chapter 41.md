The memory holds him captive, forcing him to witness the final, horrifying moments. Yao Le stands before him, bound and exposed, her face a mask of terror and desperate defiance. She has offered him a deal, a plea for mercy, clinging to the hope that her status, her grandmother's influence, might still save her.

Fang Yuan stands before her, cold and impassive, a chilling figure in the dim light of the cave. He doesn't acknowledge her offer, her plea. Instead, his gaze shifts to the large bear behind him. He reaches out a hand, gently stroking the bear’s black fur, his voice devoid of warmth, a cruel contrast to the beast's raw hunger. _"The lightning wolf tide… it ate up all the prey,"_ he says, his voice flat, conversational, as if discussing the weather. _"So, the bear hasn't eaten a proper meal for a long time."_

The bear shifts, its massive form lumbering forward, its eyes fixed on Yao Le, a hungry, predatory gaze that promises a brutal end. Yao Le’s eyes widen further, her body trembling violently against the ropes. _"Fang Yuan! Stop! What are you planning to do?! What is this?!"_ she screams, her voice raw with terror, a desperate, futile attempt to understand, to stop the inevitable.

But before she can get an answer, before her scream can fully echo in the cave, the bear provides it. With terrifying speed and immense force, it strikes. Its massive paw slams down onto Yao Le's skull.

The sound is sickening – a dull thud, followed by a sharp crack. The intense force shatters her thin neck. Her head is twisted at a grotesque, impossible angle, broken and hanging limply on one end, her eyes still wide with the terror of her final moment.

One moment ago, she was still a young girl, a symbol of innocence and hope, an alluring beauty despite her terror. The next moment, she is a broken corpse, her warm body tied to the huge rock, a discarded, brutalized toy doll.

At this moment, even without Fang Yuan's conscious control of the Bear Enslavement Martial Parasite, the big bear, driven by its primal craving for food, lowers its head. It begins to feast, its hunger overriding any semblance of hesitation.

It first starts to gnaw at the young girl’s throat, the delicate skin tearing, the flesh ripping. Fresh blood immediately bubbles out, a sickening crimson geyser, splashing onto the bear’s black fur, staining it a dark, wet red.

Next, its attention shifts to the young girl’s white and tender breasts, symbols of her burgeoning womanhood, now reduced to mere meat.

The black bear bites down on her right breast in one whole mouthful, tearing away the skin and flesh with a brutal tug, exposing her deathly pale ribs beneath.

At this moment, the black bear uses its paw, its massive claws, to break these bones, snapping them with a sickening crunch. The young girl’s internal organs are crushed, a horrifying pulp, and immediately blood pours out endlessly, a torrent of life draining away, staining the rock, the water, the bear’s fur.

Without the skeleton’s interference, the black bear places its mouth further into the girl’s body, its massive jaws opening wide. It nips at the girl’s heart, the organ still weakly beating, a final, desperate flutter of life. Then, with a single gulp, it swallows it whole.

The heart passes through its throat and into the stomach, and this bear, which has been forced to hide and starve due to the wolf tide, howls out in satisfaction, a guttural sound of primal hunger finally sated, a horrifying counterpoint to the silence that has fallen over Yao Le.

After another cry, it lowers its head again and starts to consume her internal organs wantonly, tearing and chewing with brutal efficiency.

The black bear’s mouth opens and chews, large amounts of blood gushing out from its mouth, issuing a thick, watery, sickening sound.

After a good while, the black bear finally moves its head out, its muzzle dripping with blood and gore.

The young girl’s chest is already empty, a gaping cavity, the immense injury extending to her stomach. But towards the shining, white intestines, the bear does not seem to have much interest, pushing them aside with its snout.

It starts to focus on the young girl’s white, slim legs, tearing at the flesh.

The girl’s jade-like fingers are all bitten away by the black bear at once, and with a few rounds of chewing, the fingers are swallowed with a crisp, horrifying sound.

The girl’s thighs, once soft and smooth, are also a delicacy for the bear, the tender skin and flesh emitting a faint, almost sickeningly sweet, virgin fragrance as the bear devours them. When the bear has finished, all that is left is the white leg bones, stripped clean.

Among the swaying movements of the bear, the girl’s skull, finally severed from her broken neck, drops onto the ground with a dull thud.

Fang Yuan is standing here, in the dim light of the cave, seeing her tragic and violent death, seeing the brutal consumption of her body. His heart is unmoved. His face is expressionless, his eyes cold and detached.

That is not because of numbness to death, not because he cannot feel. It is because he has gone beyond the superficial, having no obsessions, no emotional attachments to the transient nature of life and death in this world.

Without a sense of self, without a sense of person, to be detached of all living things, detached of the sense of time…

Seeing all living things as equal, the world is equal.

Thus, the girl’s brutal death is no different from a fox or a tree’s death in his eyes. They are all just parts of the world, returning to the cycle of nature.

He observes for around one hour as the black bear completely eats her up, leaving behind only a few scattered bones and a pool of blood.

The black bear is unwilling to eat the intestines and the girl’s brains, pushing them aside with its snout.

Seeing that, a flicker of annoyance crosses Fang Yuan’s face. He ponders, his thoughts cold and calculating. _"How can you not eat her up fully! You have to eat up the last piece of her, every single part, otherwise how am I going to successfully refine you into a martial elixir which will increase my talent and allow me to break through to the Rank 3 martial master realm?"_

Then, with a silent command, Fang Yuan uses the Bear Enslavement Martial Parasite that is embedded in the bear's body, asserting his absolute control through his mind. The big bear growls, a sound of pain and reluctance, and under Fang Yuan’s cruel oppression, it is forced to swallow the intestines and brain, the parts it had refused. At the same time, he forces it to break the girl’s bones into bits, crushing them with its powerful jaws, and swallows them piece by piece.

The bone shards are sharp and pointy, tearing at the bear’s flesh, but under Fang Yuan’s unwavering control, it swallows them, the pain causing the huge bear to tear up, silent tears of agony streaming down its face as the shards stab into its mouth, throat, and internal organs.

But Fang Yuan only strengthens his control, his will absolute. The bear’s body is no longer under its own control; it is merely a tool in his hands, forced to complete the horrifying task.

Fang Yuan looks at the bear expressionlessly, watching as it completely swallows Yao Le, not even a single bone spared, not a single piece of flesh left. The bear is crying out loud, a sound of immense pain, tears streaming down its face, its body wracked with spasms as the bone shards tear at its throat, mouth, and internal organs.

_"I need a virgin girl with high martial talent,"_ he thinks, the conditions of the demonic technique clear in his mind. _"And the condition is fulfilled. Yao Le was a virgin and had B-grade talent. The next condition is to feed that girl completely to an animal like a bear. That condition is also fulfilled. The third condition is to start refining the martial elixir before the bear dies from the internal damage."_ He looks at the suffering bear, its life force rapidly draining away. _"This is a demonic technique to increase someone's martial talent and rank. It is pretty cheap and effective compared to other technique as all the necessary ingredients are easy to get."_

Then, without delaying, without a moment of hesitation, Fang Yuan begins the process. He starts refining the bear, its body now a living cauldron of flesh, bone, and the remnants of Yao Le, along with all the other ingredients that he has prepared long before, gathered for this very purpose, for this very moment. The process has begun.
