The memory surges, pulling Fang Yuan back into the heart of the nightmare. The medical camp, moments before a sanctuary, is now a scene of unimaginable horror. Lightning wolves tear through the tents, their fangs dripping, their eyes burning with a savage hunger. The air is filled with screams – the screams of the injured, the screams of the medical staff, the screams of those dying a brutal death.

All the remaining martial masters around Yao Le, their faces grim with desperation, rally to protect her. Her remaining bodyguards, their armor stained with blood, the injured youths she had just tended to, even those still waiting for her healing touch – they all move as one, a desperate surge to take her to a safe distance, deeper inside the village, away from the carnage. They form a protective shield around her, their bodies a fragile barrier against the tide of death. "Protect the Young Mistress!" the shouts echo, their voices raw with urgency. "Get her to safety!"

But how can Fang Yuan, the cold, calculating observer within this memory, let them succeed? How can he allow this symbol of hope and purity to escape the chaos he has orchestrated? His gaze is fixed on the retreating group, his mind working with chilling efficiency. He must cut off their escape. He must ensure the wolf tide reaches its intended target.

Fang Yuan, hidden in the shadows, a ghost in the battlefield, begins to manipulate the chaos. He doesn't need to engage directly, his influence is far more insidious. He triggers explosions – massive, deafening blasts that rip through the very road they were following, the path meant to lead them to safety. It looks as if he had planted these charges long before, anticipating this very moment, and now, with a silent signal, he detonates them. The explosions are devastating, tearing apart the ground, collapsing buildings, and instantly killing many of the martial masters who were trying to shield Yao Le. Their bodies are thrown like ragdolls, their sacrifice rendered meaningless by a hidden hand.

The chaos intensifies, the desperate escape turning into a panicked flight. Fang Yuan, still unseen, attacks again, targeting the martial masters who are still trying to carry Yao Le, creating weak points in their already strained defense. His attacks are precise, aimed at disabling, at creating openings for the lightning wolves. The wolves, sensing the weakness, sensing the fear, attack relentlessly, their fangs finding flesh, causing the death of many more. Thanks to Fang Yuan's cold, calculated manipulation, the path to safety within the village is blocked, the defenders are decimated, and the only viable escape route for Yao Le's dwindling group leads outside the village, into the unknown darkness beyond the defenses.

As they reach the outskirts of the village, their numbers are drastically reduced. There are only three martial masters left around Yao Le – two of her original bodyguards and the injured youth she had treated earlier, his face pale with pain but his eyes filled with determination. Everyone else has died, their lives spent trying to protect her. Yao Le is crying desperately, her small body shaking with sobs, her face a mask of terror. She has never imagined something so brutal, so horrifying, could exist. The screams of those who died for her echo in her ears. "Why?" she sobs, "Why did they have to die? Why did anyone have to die?"

They stumble a bit further, putting some distance between themselves and the chaos of the village, finding a brief, fragile moment of respite. Here, outside the immediate range of the main wolf tide, there are barely any lightning wolves. One of her remaining guards, a man whose face is etched with exhaustion and sorrow, tries to offer comfort. "Young Mistress," he says, his voice rough but gentle, "don't be afraid. We will protect you. Even if it costs us our lives, we will protect you."

Yao Le cries out again, her voice filled with anguish, the question tearing from her soul. "Why do they have to die for me? Why even I have to live?"

But before the guard can comfort her, before he can offer words of hope that he himself no longer believes, they hear something. A low growl, a sound that chills them to the bone, coming from the dark, silent jungle that borders the village. They quickly take defensive positions, their bodies tense, their remaining strength gathered for a final stand. But their eyes widen in shock, their blood running cold, as they see a King Lightning Wolf, a beast of immense power and terrifying presence, emerge from the shadows of the jungle, its eyes burning with a cold, intelligent malice.

Among her guards, the male and female guard, who have stood side-by-side through this hell, exchange a look. A smile passes between them, but it is a smile that hides a deep, profound pain, a sorrow that speaks of a love that is about to be extinguished. It is the smile you give to your lover when you know, with absolute certainty, that this is the last smile you will ever share. They know this is their end. They know they cannot defeat a King Lightning Wolf.

As there are only three of them left, two guards and the injured martial master, they form a desperate, final line of defense around Yao Le. The female guard, her face pale but her eyes filled with a fierce, protective love, shouts, her voice ringing with a desperate urgency, "Young Mistress, please run! Run into the jungle! Don't look back! Don't stop!" She forces a smile, a heartbreakingly beautiful, sorrowful smile, directed at Yao Le, a silent farewell. Yao Le cries out, her voice filled with terror and despair. "How can I! How can I leave you!"

The male guard shouts, tears streaming down his face, tears of love and despair, his voice raw with emotion. "Do you want the sacrifice of all of them to go in vain? They have sacrificed themselves, their lives, to protect you! Do you want their sacrifice to be for nothing?"

The injured martial master, his body weak but his spirit unwavering, adds his voice, his gaze fixed on Yao Le. "Young Mistress! You treated me! You showed me kindness! I am deeply indebted to you! You are such a gentle soul, a light in this darkness! Don't worry about us! Please run! Live! Live for all of us!"

Then the female guard shouts again, her voice breaking with sobs, tears streaming down her face. "Please run! Please run! And don't forget our sacrifice! Don't let our sacrifice go in vain! Live, Young Mistress! Live!"

Suddenly, the King Lightning Wolf, a terrifying force of nature, lunges forward, a blur of fur and teeth, attacking them violently, brutally.

Yao Le turns and runs, her small legs pumping, her face a mask of terror, running into the dark, unforgiving jungle, the sounds of the brutal struggle, the roars of the wolf, the cries of her protectors, echoing behind her. Then, amidst the sounds of violence and death, she hears it – the final, heartbreaking shout of her male guard, his voice filled with a desperate, calling his lover's name, a final farewell in the face of death. 

She continues to run, tears streaming down her face, the terrifying sounds fading behind her, leaving her alone in the darkness, the weight of their sacrifice, the brutality of their end, crushing her young spirit.
