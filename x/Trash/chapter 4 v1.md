At the same time in Fang Yuan’s Room,

“Brother, don’t worry. I will earn a lot of primeval stones for you so that you can advance your cultivation.” Gu Xianer says while her face is very close to Fang Yuan’s face, she is directly looking into Fang Yuan’s eyes, which look innocent and watery while they can feel their breath.

“Ok, Ok, I understand. Now make some distance. I know you love me a lot. But I want to tell you something very important. You have to hear me attentively.” Fang Yuan’s says.

Gu Xianer hugs her brother and responds, “Ok, now I will listen very attentively.”

Fang Yuan says while trembling, “The day before the awakening ceremony, I had a very strange and bad dream. I wasn’t even sleeping. I was doing my casual work. Then I suddenly feel that someone is trying to control my body, and they are trying to modify my memory. All this memory was so scary.”

Gu Xianer says affectionately, “Don’t worry, brother. I am with you. Nothing will happen to you. I will protect you.”

Fang Yuan continues while his voice is trembling with horror, “At first I just saw killing millions of people vaguely. But I could still feel their screaming, fear, and crying. When I look at Fang Zheng, I suddenly see a flash where I am killing him brutally. I couldn’t recall anything, but I could feel his pain, ambition, sacrifice, and jealousy. When I look at our aunt and uncle, I see a flash, which is so vague that I can’t even recall. But I could still recall their last face before their death. I could feel their sorrow, suffering, fear, betrayal, and also a tiny hope before I killed them brutally. Whenever I look at our clanman and our classmate, I could recall their death and their fear.”

Gu Xianer hugs Fang Yuan tightly and shouts, “Stop your nonsense. I will not hear this bad story. Every day you tell me a good story before I go to bed. But why are you telling me a bad story today? I don’t want to hear this kind of story. Tell me the story where brother and sister live happily, not the story where brother or sister sacrifice them.”

Fang Yuans directly stares at Gu Xianer’s eyes with his watery eyes while also hugging her for a while. Gu Xianer looks into Fang Yuans eyes from where tears are falling like streams. Gu Xianer can’t say anything, and tears start gathering in her eyes.

Fang Yuan innocent eyes turn into an eerie and endless abyss for an instant.

Fang Yuan starts crying loudly and says, “Other days, I have tried to kill you many times. Even now, for an instant, I thought that I would kill you.” Saying so, Fang Yuan starts crying loudly. Gu Xianer also starts crying loudly while they both hug each other tightly while sitting on the bed. Gu Xianer shouts while crying, “Don’t worry, brother, I will protect you. Even if you kill me, I will love you.”

  

Hearing their loud crying, Fang Zheng, Aunt, and Uncle rush to their room. They become startled-looking Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer are crying loudly while they are hugging each other. Uncle asks with confusion, “What is wrong? Why are you crying?” Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer don’t respond and continue their crying. After a while, Fang Yuan says, “We were crying because we want to cry together. It is nothing important.” Gu Xianer adds, “I want to cry with my big brother.” Everyone becomes shocked and also shows some annoyance. After talking for some time, they all leave the room and go to their room. 

  

In Fang Zheng’s room, Fang Zheng ponders with a hint of frustration and anger, “You were crying because you want to cry. Don’t warry. I will make sure that you both cry for real. You annoying fly.”

  

In Fang Yuan’s room, Fang Yuan tells a story where brother and sister live happily and Gu Xianer falls asleep. At that time, Fang Yuan innocent eyes turn into an endless abyss. He gets up from bed and looks at the moon, which can hardly be seen. In his mind, Administrator Fang Yuan says, “So, your plan has worked. The fast part of your plan is complete. Now the second part will begin. For the second part, you have made two ways. Which way would you like to take?”

Logical Fang Yuan responds indifferently, “Why bother asking? You already know?”

Administrator Fang Yuan says with a smile, “I can read your mind, but it is boring without communication.”

Logical Fang Yuan doesn't reply. Administrator Fang Yuan says, “You have known that you can’t do anything that is subconsciously rejected by Illogical Fang Yuan. So, you came up with a plan where you will make him separate from his sister because your illogical personality would never leave his sister and you can’t do anything about it. Now your illogical personality thinks that he might lose control and kill his beloved sister. So, your illogical personality subconsciously supported you that you could leave this village but can’t harm anyone.”

Logical personality responds with a small nod of affirmation.

Administrator personality adds, “You know that your brother is plotting against you. You have even found out that he is another worldly demon. You even know that your brother knows about the future, but he is not from the future. Don’t you want to know your brother’s true identity? How has he known the future? I have told you that I can use my power. If you ask me, I could tell you about his full background and backstory and even what he is planning.”

Fang Yuan responds, “It doesn’t matter. An ant is always an ant. No matter how vicious the plan of an ant is, it couldn’t even disrupt the path of an elephant. The elephant doesn’t even bother looking at an ant. If an ant stands before an elephant, the ant will be perished under the elephant’s paw, and even more interesting is that the elephant’s would never know that he has accidentally perished an ant.”

Administrator Fang Yuan says, “In the second part of your plan, you have made two ways to accomplish it. The first one doesn’t need my help, but the second one needs my help. I know you will go with the first one, but I will help you a little, so I think you have to go with the second one. In your first plan, you will approach the clan leader using the academy elder. You will pretend that you have a master who is powerful, and he wants to have a little chat with the clan leader through you. To make him believe you, you will go to him with an innocent face and then suddenly change it to an indifference and eerie face. And then talk to him as Fang Yuan’s master, who is resting somewhere in Qing Mao Mountain. I know this is a good plan without any flaw. In your second plan, I will just have to send a message or make him see this dream, and everything will be smooth. Don’t you think this is easy?”

Logical Fang Yuan doesn’t reply and continues to look at the night sky with indifference.
