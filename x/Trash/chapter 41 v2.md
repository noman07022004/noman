The air was thick with tension as Fang Yuan turned to face them, his lips curling into a gentle, almost tender smile. But the warmth of that smile did little to ease the terror gripping Gu Wang and Yao Le. Their bodies trembled violently, their wide eyes locked onto him like prey staring down an apex predator. Every fiber of their being screamed danger, even though his expression radiated nothing but calm affection.

Gu Xianer, however, stood apart from the others. Her small frame didn’t shake; instead, her eyes sparkled with admiration. She clapped her hands together excitedly, shouting without hesitation, “Brother is really cool!”

Fang Yuan’s grin widened at her words, his gaze softening further as he looked at her. “Yes, your brother *is* cool,” he replied, his voice dripping with playful pride. He leaned closer to her, his tone teasing yet filled with exaggerated affection. “How can I not be cool if I have such an adorable, cute sister?”

Yao Le swallowed hard, trying desperately to muster some semblance of courage despite the fear coursing through her veins. Her voice came out shaky, barely above a whisper. “W-Who… Who are you really?” 

Her question hung in the air, heavy and uncertain. Beside her, Gu Wang shuddered visibly, her own horror spilling over as she blurted out, “You… You can’t be Fang Yuan! You’re not him! This isn’t possible!”

Fang Yuan tilted his head slightly, his smile remaining gentle—but it only seemed to deepen their fear. The more serene he appeared, the more they recoiled, trembling uncontrollably under his unwavering gaze. It was as though his very presence had become suffocating, a storm cloaked in deceptive calmness.

“Don’t be afraid of me,” he said softly, his voice carrying an eerie sincerity. His eyes flickered between them before settling on Gu Xianer, who watched him with unshakable trust. Slowly, he knelt before her, lowering himself until they were eye level. His piercing gaze locked onto hers, and for a moment, time seemed to freeze.

“My little Xianer,” he murmured, his tone both tender and commanding. “Tell me—who am I?”

Gu Xianer blinked up at him, her innocence shining brightly against the backdrop of chaos. Without a second’s hesitation, she answered, her voice ringing clear and unwavering. “You’re my big brother. You love me very much, and I love you too.”

A flicker of something unreadable passed through Fang Yuan’s eyes—pride? Sadness? Madness?—before his grin returned, wider and sharper than before. He straightened up, turning back to Gu Wang and Yao Le, his demeanor shifting effortlessly between playful mockery and unsettling dominance.

“See?” he said, gesturing dramatically toward Gu Xianer. “My sister has already answered your questions. Isn’t she wonderful?”

But Gu Wang couldn’t let it go. Summoning every ounce of bravery she possessed, she stepped forward, her voice rising with desperation. “No! That can’t be true! He’s not your brother—he can’t be! Look at how everyone fears him! Look at what he just did! No one acts like this unless they’re a monster!”

Her words cut through the tense atmosphere like a blade, but Gu Xianer merely shook her head, her expression firm. “I know my brother’s personality has changed,” she admitted, her voice steady despite the weight of the situation. “But I don’t mind. In fact, I love this version of my brother even more. Before, he always kept his distance, never letting me hug or kiss him. Now, he doesn’t get angry when I do those things. Instead, he hugs and kisses me back.” Her cheeks flushed faintly as she added, “And he rubs his cheeks with mine all the time. It makes me happy.”

She paused, her gaze softening as memories surfaced. “I remember how everyone used to bully my brother because of me. He suffered so much for my sake, and I felt guilty about it every day. But now…” Her voice grew stronger, filled with conviction. “Now, he looks strong. So strong that no one will ever hurt us again. And honestly, I don’t care what anyone says—I love my brother exactly as he is.”

The room fell silent after her declaration, the weight of her words hanging heavily in the air. Fang Yuan stared at her, his expression unreadable for a fleeting moment. Then, slowly, a manic laugh bubbled up from deep within him, growing louder and wilder until it echoed through the space like thunder.

“HA HA HA!” he roared, clutching his stomach as tears of mirth streamed down his face. “This is my sister! MY SISTER! HA HA HA!” 

He wiped at his eyes theatrically, still chuckling as he turned back to Gu Xianer. “Alright then, my precious angelic sister, allow your brother to fulfill the sacred duty of siblings—a bond so pure, so divine, that only I am worthy of performing it!” With that, he lunged forward, grabbing her face and rubbing his cheeks against hers with exaggerated enthusiasm.

“SO SOFT! TOO CUTE! I CAN’T HANDLE IT!” he exclaimed, his laughter blending seamlessly with the absurdity of the moment. Gu Xianer giggled, squirming slightly under his affectionate assault but clearly enjoying the attention.

When he finally pulled away, Gu Xianer pouted playfully, tugging on his sleeve. “Brother, let me complete my divine duty too!”

Fang Yuan froze mid-laugh, his eyes widening comically as he processed her request. Then, another wave of uncontrollable laughter erupted from him, shaking his entire body. “HA HA HA! THIS IS WHY YOU’RE MY CUTE ANGELIC SISTER! HA HA HA!”

With a dramatic flourish, he nodded, leaning forward expectantly. “Go ahead, my sweet Xianer. Show me your divine duty.”

Gu Xianer beamed, reaching up to rub her cheeks against his with the same innocent determination she applied to everything else. As she did, Fang Yuan sighed contentedly, closing his eyes as though savoring the moment.

Meanwhile, Gu Wang and Yao Le could only stare in stunned disbelief, their minds struggling to reconcile the horrifying violence they’d witnessed with the bizarre display of sibling affection unfolding before them.
