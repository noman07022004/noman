The next day afternoon,

Gu Yue Bo wakes up but still feels intense pain. Fang Yuan is expressionlessly looking at him. Fang Yuan gives him some gu worms to consume. After consuming those gu worms, he feels relief. With an indifferent face, Fang Yuan says, “I am truly disappointed in you. I thought you could hold at least 1 minute so that I could give you these Gu worms."

Gu Yue Bo can’t even respond. He is very shocked and, even more, very frightened.

Fang Yuan orders, “ Now I will give you a critical mission. If you can’t complete it, don’t blame me for killing you.”

Gu Yue Bo responds, trembling, “I will do as you say.”

Fang Yuan gives several Gu worms to Gu Yue Bo and says, “This Gu worm will help to become invisible, and no one could detect you if they don’t have any powerful investigative method. This Gu will help you run through shadows at night. This Gu will help you to capture the Gu master silently. And this Gu worm will help you make someone unconscious without them knowing. Tonight, you have to capture Bai Ning Bing from the Bai clan. Don’t let anyone know about your cultivation level.”

Gu Yue Bo becomes very excited seeing all these gu and also becomes very frightened of doing anything wrong. He fearfully responds, “I will do everything as you have said, high and mighty immortal. Your servant will do as you have said.”

  

In the deep night,

Gu Yue Bo comes and kneels before Fang Yuan and reports with the utmost respect, “Esteemed immortal, you lowly servant has brought Bai Ning Bing without making a single mistake.” 

Fang Yuan checks Bai Ning Bing and then orders Gu Yue Bo, “Go and bring at least one million primeval stones.” 

Even without making any excuse, Gu Yue Bo leaves with respect and after some time comes back and offers a Gu worm while kneeling, “Esteemed immortal, in this gu worm, I have brought all my life saving which is about 1.7 million primeval stones.” 

Fang Yuan responds, “Good job. Now place your hand on Bai Ning Bing. It will be a painful process. Prepare yourself.” 

Gu Yue Bo does as Fang Yuan has instructed. Then Fang Yuan places his hands on Gu Yue Bo’s back. Then, he uses several gu worms which he has refined before. Suddenly, Bai Ning Bing starts shaking violently even though he is unconscious. After some time, Gu Yue Bo starts shaking. Fang Yuan uses a gu worm on Gu Yue Bo which makes him calm. After some time, the seawater level of Fang Yuan’s primeval aperture starts rising which is very little that it is hard to notice. Fang Yuan continues this process.

  

After 2 days,

Gu Yue Bo looks extremely skinny. Bai Ning Bing looks like a zombie who has no vitality. But Fang Yuan looks extremely healthy. Fang Yuan uses some gu worms on Bai Ning Bing And Gu Yue Bo which makes them look normal. Even after that, Gu Yue Bo feels extremely weak and dizzy. Fang Yuan orders Gu Yue Bo, “Go and place Bai Ning Bing near his village without letting anyone know. After that, you have to rest for at least 7 days because you will collapse after some time on your own. So, go quickly and complete your mission.”

After Gu Yue Bo takes his leave while carrying Bai Ning Bing, Fang Yuan ponders, “Everything is going smoothly. I have absorbed the talent of Bai Ning Bing while maintaining minimal loss. Now, Bai Ning Bing has 0 talents. He can never cultivate again without special opportunity. Now, He is just a mortal who has no cultivation talent. I have also used about 1.2 million primeval stones in the process. Now my cultivation talents are about 76% which was only 17% and I have also got the attributes of Northern Dark Ice Soul physiques without its drawback. This is not bad as this method has no negative effect. This method is quite expensive. It was good that I was only at rank one middle stage. If I were ranked 3, it would cause at least 100 million primeval stones to get the same result. It would be even better if I could absorb the talent of Gu Xianer who has a divine body. If I absorb a divine body, my cultivation talent would become 100% and even more astonishing is that I won’t get any extreme physique but I would gain a part of divine physique without any negative effect. In the future, I could absorb an even more divine physique which would give me a portion of that physique. Even, when I just think about it while controlling my body, I get intense resistance from both Innocent Fang Yuan and Unpredictable Fang Yuan. Even though Innocent Fang Yuan hasn’t inherited any of my memories, Unpredictable Fang Yuan has inherited all of my memories. Even after inheriting all my memories, he thinks differently from me. It looks like he is unpredictable for some reason.”

In Fang Yuan’s head, Administrative Fang Yuan says, “Now the third phase has been completed. The fourth and final phase will start ten days after the merchant caravan arrives here. At last, we will leave this mountain with the merchant caravan.” 

Fang Yuan sits down and starts cultivating using the gu worms and half a million primeval stones.

  

At night in Fang Zheng’s room

Fang Zheng is lying on the bed while pondering, “Everything is going smoothly. Gu Yue Mo Yan, the daughter of the Mo faction, has fallen for me. Now she loves me very much. I have even gotten thousands of primeval stones from the Mo faction through Gu Yue Mo Yao. I have even kissed her many times. The other day, we were about to do everything. It would be good if I could make her pregnant suddenly. Then the whole Mo faction would be under my control. I am controlling Chi faction through Gu Yue Chi Chen’s fake talent and I am also making a very good relationship with Gu Yue Chi Chen, which makes his grandfather feel relief. Normally, a rank 1 peak gu master should have more than 100 primeval stones, a rank 2 peak gu master should have more than 1,000 primeval stones, a rank three peak gu master should have at least 10,000, a rank 4 peak gu master should have at least 100,000 and rank 5 peak gu master should have at least 1,000,000 primeval stones. This would be right if they are very normal, like a rank 5 peak gu master may have more than 100 million primeval stones. Now I am at the rank 1 peak stage. If I use normal calculation, I should have more than 100 primeval stones in my stock. If I am poor, I should have more than 10 but less than 100. If I want to consider myself rich, I should have more than 100 but less than 1000. Currently, I have more than 6,000 primeval stones. I am much richer than most of the rank 2 GU masters. Ha, ha, ha.”

He wakes up from his bed and then looks at the moon with a satisfied smile and shouts in his heart, “I am way ahead of Fang Yuan. He might not have any primeval stones. He, he, he. Now, I am in total control of the Mo and Chi factions. I have lost some of my control in the medicine hall. The successor of the medicine hall, Yao Le, is hanging around with Gu Xianer. It looks like they have become very good friends during the time Gu Xianer was in the medicine hall for treatment. This servant girl, Gu Wang, is even more annoying. I have tried many ways on her but she doesn’t give me any responses that I want. Gu Wang and his brother Wang Er are annoying. They follow only Gu Xianer. Even their father Old Man Wang follows her. Even though they show me respect properly, they all follow Gu Xianer from their heart. Even Gu Xianer cares about them. I was thinking about influencing Gu Xianer using them, it looks like I need to change my plan. It looks like I also can’t execute my plan for Fang Yuan to rape her sister, Gu Xianer. It looks like my plan for the clan leader will also not work. It looks like all my plans have gone wrong just for Fang Yuan. It looks like Heaven’s will is using Fang Yuan to limit my growth and Gu Xianer is an assistant for it. I will need to create a proper plan to eliminate both of them. For now, let's enhance the plan for the merchant caravan. If I could execute everything properly, I could earn at least 1,000 primeval stones to 4,000 primeval stones.” Fang Zheng’s devilish smile echoes through the room which is dark and gloomy which makes an eerie environment.

  

At the same time in Gu Xianer’s room,

Gu Xianer is trying to advance from the rank 1 middle stage to the rank 1 upper stage. After some time, Gu Xianer gives up and lies down on the bed. Gu Wang who is also lying on the bed beside Gu Xianer asks, “Young mistress, you have been trying to see your brother for the last few days after you have been woken up but the clan elder is not allowing you to visit young master Fang Yuan. What could be the reason?” With a deep sigh, Gu Xianer responds, “Call me Sister Xianer first. And I will call you Sister Wang.” Gu Wang responds, “Yes, Sister Xianer.” Gu Xianer adds, “I don’t know the reason. But the clan leader says that Fang Yuan is well and I will be allowed to visit him only If I can surpass Fang Zheng.” Gu Wang asks, “Then why is everyone making young master Fang Yuan a bad person, and why everyone is saying that young master is holding you back and he is envious of you and even many bad things that I can’t say it. They are even saying that the young master has a bad eye on you and that he was planning to do something bad with you. Young Master loves you. I can still remember the young master’s face when my brother Wang Er brought him to our house. Whenever I recall his condition, It makes me frightened. He can never think bad about you.” Gu Xianer doesn’t respond as if she is suffocated, her heart can’t breathe and every tear of her eyes is crying.
