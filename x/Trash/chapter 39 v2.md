The market falls deathly silent, the kind of silence that precedes a storm. Fang Yuan halts abruptly, his gaze flicking lazily over the group as if they were insects beneath his feet. Beside him, Gu Xianer, Gu Wang, and Yao Le turn to face the newcomers, their faces pale with dread.

Gu Wang’s eyes dart frantically to the bold inscription on the leader’s belt—‘2’—marking him as a Rank Two Gu Master. Her breath catches in her throat like a trapped bird, her chest heaving uncontrollably. Before she can stop herself, her voice bursts out in sheer panic, trembling and broken:

“He—He’s a **Rank Two Gu Master** !”

Her small frame shakes violently, terror coursing through her veins like ice water. Gu Xianer stiffens beside her, her tiny hands clutching the fabric of her sleeves so tightly that her knuckles turn white. The aggressive sneers of the men, the suffocating aura of killing intent radiating from them—it all becomes too much to bear. Even Yao Le feels a cold shiver crawl down her spine, her scholarly composure crumbling under the weight of their menacing presence. Yet, despite the paralyzing fear gripping her heart, she takes a hesitant step forward, instinctively trying to shield the others.

But before she can act—

Fang Yuan freezes.

His expression contorts into one of pure, unadulterated terror. His body trembles violently, his wide eyes glistening with tears he cannot hold back. His lips quiver as he stammers, his voice cracking with desperation:  
“P-Please… let us go! I—I didn’t mean to offend any Gu Master! Please forgive my ignorance! We’re just simple travelers!”

The crowd watches in stunned silence, their collective breath held.

Then—a wave of cruel snickering ripples through the market, growing louder and more vicious by the second.

“Ha! Look at him, shaking like a leaf caught in a hurricane!” one man jeers, his voice dripping with mockery.  
“Didn’t this brat strut around like he owned the place moments ago? Where’s all that arrogance now?” another calls out, laughing harshly.  
“So much for his big talk! Real Gu Masters show up, and suddenly he’s nothing but a sniveling coward!”

Laughter erupts, sharp and cutting, echoing off the walls of the market like shards of glass slicing through the air.

The Gu Masters smirk, their cruel grins widening as they close in on Fang Yuan like predators circling wounded prey. The middle-aged leader steps forward, his towering figure casting a shadow over Fang Yuan. His scarred face twists into a sneer, his voice laced with disdain.  
“What’s wrong, brat? You were running your mouth earlier. Where did all that bravado disappear to?”

Another Gu Master leans in, his breath hot and rancid against Fang Yuan’s ear. “Hah! What, you think pretending to cry will make us go easy on you? Begging won’t save you—or those girls behind you.”

They press closer, their laughter turning darker, crueller, each word a dagger aimed at Fang Yuan’s dignity. One of them flicks Fang Yuan’s forehead with deliberate force, sending his head snapping back. “Scared now, little worm?”

Another shoves him hard in the shoulder, knocking him off balance. “Hey,” the man spits, interrupting himself with a hacking cough, “maybe if you lick my boot and drink my piss, I’ll consider letting you crawl away with your pathetic life.”

Fang Yuan stumbles backward, his face a mask of abject helplessness. Tears stream freely down his cheeks as his breathing quickens, his hands clutching the hem of his robe like a lifeline. His voice cracks, raw and desperate:  
“Please forgive me for my ignorance! I swear it was unintentional! We can give you everything we own as compensation! Just spare us!”

The Gu Masters roar with laughter, their voices overlapping in a cacophony of cruelty.  
“No mercy in this world, boy!” one of them barks, wiping tears of mirth from his eyes. “You’ll pay for your arrogance—and your stupidity. Ha ha ha!”

Fang Yuan’s body trembles violently, his lips quivering as he collapses to his knees. He clasps his hands together in a pitiful gesture of supplication, lowering his forehead until it nearly touches the dirt. His voice is hoarse, filled with raw, unrelenting desperation:  
“P-Please… have mercy! I—I was wrong! I didn’t mean to offend you! Please, I beg of you!”

The leader of the Gu Masters throws his head back and laughs, the sound echoing through the market like thunder. He folds his arms across his chest, sneering down at Fang Yuan with undisguised contempt.  
“Hah! Look at him! Talks tough when no one’s watching, but grovels like a dog when faced with real power!”

The crowd joins in, their laughter ringing out like nails scraping against stone.  
“Beg louder, brat!” another Gu Master mocks, kicking dust toward Fang Yuan’s face. “Maybe if you kiss our boots and lap up the filth, we’ll let you slither away like the worm you are!”

Fang Yuan clutches at the ground, his fingers digging into the dirt as if searching for some semblance of stability. He forces his body to shake harder, his voice rising in pitch, bordering on hysteria:  
“P-Please! I’ll do anything! Anything! Just let us go!”

The leader steps closer, his shadow looming over Fang Yuan like an executioner’s blade. He tilts his head mockingly, pretending to consider the plea. His eyes gleam with sadistic amusement as he speaks, his voice slow and deliberate:  
“Anything, huh? Then how about this—bark like a dog. Let’s see how sincere your begging really is.”

The Gu Masters erupt into hysterical laughter, doubling over as if Fang Yuan’s humiliation is the greatest entertainment they’ve ever witnessed.

Fang Yuan flinches, his hands tightening into fists for the briefest moment before he forces himself to comply. But just as he opens his mouth to obey—

**SMACK!**

A heavy hand slams across Fang Yuan’s face with brutal force, sending his head snapping to the side. Blood sprays from his split lip, staining the ground beneath him. His vision blurs, stars exploding behind his eyelids as pain shoots through his skull. Before he can steady himself, his legs buckle, and he crashes to the ground in a heap.

Dust rises around him, swirling like a funeral shroud as the onlookers erupt into cheers and mocking laughter.

“Pathetic!” someone shouts, their voice dripping with disgust.  
“Not so tough now, are you?!” another taunts, spitting on the ground near Fang Yuan’s prone form.  
“Look at him, rolling in the dirt like the worthless worm he is!”

Gu Xianer, Gu Wang, and Yao Le freeze in place, their bodies rigid with terror. The air around them thickens, suffocating, as the reality of their situation sinks in.

Gu Wang gasps sharply, her hands clutching her sleeves so tightly that her knuckles turn ghostly white. Her entire body trembles like a leaf caught in a storm. “F-Fang Yuan…” she whispers hoarsely, her voice barely audible over the pounding of her own heart. Tears well up in her eyes, but they do not fall—she is too paralyzed by fear to even cry.

Yao Le sucks in a sharp, ragged breath, her lips parting as if to scream. She wants to shout it out loud—_‘My grandmother is the Medicine Hall Leader!’_ —but the words die in her throat, choked off by an invisible hand of dread. Her mind races, desperate for some way out, but all she can do is stand there, trembling like a cornered animal.

But Gu Xianer—  
Her mind goes blank, wiped clean by a surge of raw, unrelenting fury. Without hesitation, she steps forward, her small frame standing defiantly between Fang Yuan and the menacing Gu Masters. Her chest heaves with every labored breath, and her eyes burn with a fiery defiance that seems far too fierce for someone so young.

“**LET HIM GO! DON’T YOU DARE TOUCH MY BROTHER!”** she screams at the top of her lungs, her voice shrill and piercing, laced with desperation and rage. It cuts through the oppressive silence like a blade, causing the crowd to falter for a moment, their mocking laughter dying abruptly.

The Gu Masters exchange glances, their sneers twisting into something darker, more sinister. Their predatory gazes sweep over the three girls, taking them in fully for the first time. They see Gu Wang’s innocent beauty, Yao Le’s delicate charm, and Gu Xianer’s trembling defiance—and their intentions shift.

One of the Gu Masters licks his lips slowly, his tongue dragging across them like a snake tasting the air. His grin widens, revealing yellowed teeth.  
“Damn… didn’t notice before, but these little flowers are quite the catch,” he says, his voice dripping with lewd intent.

Another chuckles darkly, his eyes locking onto Gu Xianer. “Especially that little spitfire. Feisty ones always make things more fun.” He leans closer, his gaze raking over her like filth. “I bet she’d beg real nice once we break her spirit.”

Gu Wang’s stomach churns violently, bile rising in her throat. A primal, gut-wrenching terror grips her—a feeling she has never known before. It chokes her, suffocates her, until she feels like she might collapse under its weight. She wants to run. She wants to scream. But her legs refuse to obey, rooted to the spot as if bound by chains.

The leader of the Gu Masters steps forward, his scarred face splitting into a grotesque smile. His voice oozes malice, each word landing like a hammer blow.  
“Well now, how about this?” he drawls, circling them like a vulture sizing up its prey. “If all three of you behave yourselves and serve us properly…” He pauses, letting the implication hang heavy in the air. “…we _might_ just let your precious brat here crawl away with his pathetic life intact.” He lets out a cruel laugh, the sound grating against their ears. “And who knows? Maybe one of you will get lucky enough to become my personal servant—or plaything.”

His words hit like a physical force, sending waves of nausea crashing over Gu Wang. Her legs buckle beneath her, and she sways unsteadily, fighting to stay upright. Yao Le shakes violently, her breath coming in shallow, panicked gasps. She opens her mouth, forcing the words out despite the terror gripping her throat.  
“M-My grandmother is—”

But the rest of the sentence dies on her lips, strangled by the overwhelming fear that clamps down on her like a vice. Tears stream down her face as she realizes the futility of her words. No title, no connection, no plea will save them now.

Gu Xianer refuses to yield. Something stronger than fear takes hold of her—a fierce protectiveness for her brother, a fire that burns brighter than any terror. Her small frame trembles with an intensity that seems impossible for someone so young, yet she steps forward again, her tiny fists clenched so tightly that her nails dig into her palms, drawing blood. Her whole body shakes—not from weakness, but from the sheer force of her resolve. She is no longer just a child; in this moment, she is a storm ready to unleash its fury.

“**DON’T YOU DARE TOUCH MY BROTHER!”** she shrieks again, her voice cracking under the weight of raw emotion, but filled with unshakable determination. Her eyes blaze with a childlike ferocity, wild and untamed, like flames licking at the edges of sanity. For a fraction of a second, the Gu Masters pause, their sneers faltering as they glimpse something primal in her gaze—something that dares them to come closer.

But then—they laugh. Harsh, mocking laughter erupts from their throats, echoing through the market like the cawing of vultures circling carrion. Their faces twist into grotesque masks of cruelty, their eyes gleaming with predatory intent.

“She’s got a mouth on her, huh?” one sneers, his grin widening into something vile. “I wonder how long she’ll keep talking back when we’re done with her.”

“I call dibs on the feisty one,” another growls, his gaze raking over Gu Xianer’s trembling form with undisguised hunger. “She’ll learn her place soon enough.”

The leader chuckles darkly, his voice oozing malice. “Let’s break her spirit first. Make her beg before we take what we want.”

They close in, surrounding Gu Xianer, Gu Wang, and Yao Le like wolves closing in on wounded prey. Their hands reach out—filthy, greedy, vile—toward the girls. Each movement drips with lustful anticipation, their breaths coming faster, their eyes clouded with depravity. They are monsters wearing human skin, their intentions clear and horrifying.

“Come here, little girl,” the leader purrs, his hand hovering near Gu Xianer’s cheek. “Don’t be afraid. We’ll take _real_ good care of you.”

“You’ll enjoy yourself once you stop resisting,” another whispers, his fingers brushing against Yao Le’s arm. “Trust me.”

“Such soft skin…” a third mutters, his hand nearing Gu Wang’s trembling shoulder. “I can’t wait to see how loud you scream.”

The girls squeeze their eyes shut, their bodies rigid with terror. Tears stream down Gu Wang’s face as she tries to shrink away, her mind screaming for escape but her body frozen in place. Yao Le bites her lip until it bleeds, trying to suppress the sobs clawing at her throat. And Gu Xianer—her defiance flickers, replaced by a gut-wrenching fear that threatens to consume her. But even now, her fists remain clenched, her jaw set, her heart pounding like a war drum.

And then—

A sound cuts through the air. Low, chilling, almost imperceptible. A soft exhale, like the whisper of death itself.

It comes from Fang Yuan.

Still lying in the dirt where he had fallen moments ago, still looking weak—but his presence shifts. The air around him thickens, heavy with an oppressive energy that makes the very ground beneath everyone’s feet seem unstable. His eyes, once wide with mock terror, are now empty. Void. Like twin abysses staring into the souls of those who dare approach him. There is no mercy in them, no humanity—only a cold, calculating brutality that promises suffering beyond comprehension.

The Gu Masters freeze mid-reach, their instincts screaming warnings their minds cannot comprehend. Too late. In the span of a millisecond—faster than the blink of an eye—Fang Yuan moves.

His hand shoots out, impossibly fast, grabbing the wrist of the leader who had dared extend his filthy fingers toward Gu Xianer. With a sickening crunch, the bone shatters like glass. The man screams, collapsing to his knees, clutching his mangled limb as agony ripples through him. Before the others can react, Fang Yuan’s other hand lashes out, snapping the wrist of the man reaching for Yao Le. Another crack echoes through the market as the third man’s arm twists unnaturally, the sound of tendons tearing and bones grinding together sending shivers down everyone’s spines.

The Gu Masters stagger back, clutching their ruined limbs, their faces contorted in pain and disbelief. Blood pools beneath their hands, staining the dirt red. Their screams fill the air, high-pitched and desperate, but Fang Yuan doesn’t stop there. He rises slowly to his feet, each step deliberate, each movement radiating an aura of pure, unrelenting menace. The crowd watches in stunned silence, paralyzed by the sheer killing intent emanating from him. It’s suffocating, like being buried alive under mountains of ice.

Fang Yuan tilts his head, his expression eerily calm despite the chaos unfolding around him. When he speaks, his voice is soft, almost gentle—but laced with a venomous cruelty that makes every word cut deeper than any blade.

“You think yourselves worthy of touching them?” he murmurs, his tone conversational, as though discussing the weather. “You pathetic insects. You dared lay your filthy hands on what belongs to me.”

He turns his gaze to the leader, who is writhing on the ground, clutching his shattered wrist. Fang Yuan kneels beside him, his movements fluid and unhurried. With a single finger, he taps the man’s forehead. The leader freezes, his eyes widening in terror as Fang Yuan’s power surges through him, paralyzing him completely. Not a single muscle in his body responds. He is trapped, helpless, utterly at Fang Yuan’s mercy—or lack thereof.

Fang Yuan leans in close, his lips curling into a smile that sends chills down everyone’s spines. “Do you know what happens to those who cross me?” he whispers, his voice dripping with sadistic glee. “I don’t kill them outright. No, that would be too kind. I make sure they live long enough to regret ever meeting me.”

With a flick of his wrist, Fang Yuan breaks another bone in the leader’s hand, eliciting a strangled cry. Then another. And another. Each snap echoes through the market, punctuated by the man’s screams, which grow hoarser with each passing second. Fang Yuan works methodically, clinically, as if dissecting a specimen rather than torturing a living being. By the time he finishes, the leader’s hands are nothing more than mangled heaps of flesh and bone, useless and irreparable.

The other Gu Masters try to crawl away, their faces pale with terror, their bodies shaking uncontrollably. But Fang Yuan isn’t done. He strides toward them, his footsteps slow and deliberate, each step amplifying the dread in their hearts. One of them collapses onto his stomach, sobbing hysterically, begging for mercy. Fang Yuan crouches beside him, tilting his head curiously.

“Mercy?” he repeats, his voice soft and mocking. “What is that? Do you think I care about your pitiful pleas?”

Without warning, he slams his foot down onto the man’s leg, crushing it with such force that the bone pierces through the skin. The man howls, thrashing wildly, but Fang Yuan pins him down effortlessly, applying pressure until the screams turn into whimpers. He repeats the process with the other two, breaking bones, tearing ligaments, ensuring maximum pain without causing immediate death. Every action is precise, calculated, designed to prolong their suffering.

By the time Fang Yuan rises to his feet, the Gu Masters are nothing more than quivering wrecks, their bodies shattered and broken, their spirits utterly crushed. They lie in pools of their own blood, whimpering like wounded animals caught in a merciless trap. The market is deathly silent, save for the faint sound of their pathetic groans. Every eye in the crowd is fixed on the scene before them—unable to look away, unable to comprehend the sheer brutality they have just witnessed. Even the girls—Gu Xianer, Gu Wang, and Yao Le—are frozen where they stand, their initial relief at being saved quickly giving way to shock, revulsion, and an unshakable sense of dread.
