Suddenly, Fang Yuan raises a hand, his voice cutting through the tense silence like a blade. “Sit,” he commands, his tone firm but not unkind. The authority in his voice leaves no room for argument.

Gu Wang and Yao Le comply immediately, their bodies still trembling with residual fear as they lower themselves to the ground. They sit stiffly, their wide eyes darting nervously toward Fang Yuan, unsure of what’s coming next. Every movement feels heavy, every breath shallow, as though the weight of his presence alone is enough to crush them.

But Gu Xianer? She doesn’t hesitate. With an innocent smile lighting up her face, she plops down beside Fang Yuan without a trace of fear. Her small hands fold neatly in her lap, and she tilts her head slightly, gazing at him with pure adoration. To her, this moment isn’t frightening—it’s precious. It’s another chance to be closer to her beloved brother.

Fang Yuan glances at her briefly, his lips curling into a faint, almost imperceptible smile before it vanishes. He turns back to the others, his expression unreadable yet commanding. “Let me make something clear,” he begins, his voice low and deliberate, each word dripping with purpose. “So that none of you have any lingering doubts or misunderstandings about who I am—or _what_ I am.”

The air thickens. Even Gu Xianer senses the shift in his tone, her cheerful demeanor softening into rapt attention. Fang Yuan leans forward slightly, resting his elbows on his knees as he fixes his gaze on her. His voice softens, becoming gentle, coaxing—like a storyteller preparing to weave a tale for a cherished listener.

“How about this?” he murmurs, his eyes locking onto hers with warmth that seems oddly out of place given the carnage they’ve just witnessed. “I’ll tell you my life story—in short. Would you like that?”

Gu Xianer’s face lights up instantly, her entire being radiating excitement. “Yes, Brother!” she exclaims, clapping her tiny hands together. “Tell me everything!”

For a fleeting moment, Fang Yuan’s features soften further, his lips curving into a genuine smile—one that holds a flicker of affection so raw it’s almost jarring against the backdrop of madness that defines him. But just as quickly, the tenderness fades, replaced by something darker, more intense. His gaze hardens, and when he speaks again, his voice carries a depth of emotion that sends shivers down everyone’s spines.

“I lived in a destined world,” he begins, his tone measured but laced with bitterness. “A world where fate dictated everything—and nothing could escape its grasp.” He pauses, letting the words sink in, his eyes distant as if recalling memories long buried. “I was an orphan. Alone. No family, no name, no future. Yet, despite all odds, I clawed my way through life. I studied. I worked. I became a scholar—a man of knowledge, respected and admired. And for once…” His voice cracks ever so slightly, tinged with nostalgia. “…for once, I found happiness. I had a wife. A child. A home. I died peacefully, surrounded by love.”

His expression shifts abruptly, twisting into one of quiet rage. “But death was not the end. Oh no. When I opened my eyes again, I found myself here—in _this_ world. At first, I thought—I truly believed—that I was blessed. That I would live a second life filled with joy, free from suffering.” His laughter erupts suddenly, sharp and hollow, echoing through the silent market. “How wrong I was.”

He looks directly at Gu Xianer now, his voice dropping to a whisper, heavy with sorrow. “In that life… you weren’t even born. There was no sister. Just me and my little brother, Fang Zheng.” The mention of his brother’s name brings a flash of pain to his eyes, quickly masked by anger. “Fang Zheng… the prodigy. The golden child. An A-grade talent. While I?” He scoffs bitterly, shaking his head. “I was a C-grade talent. Weak. Useless. A shadow compared to him.”

His fists clench tightly, knuckles whitening as his voice grows louder, more impassioned. “Do you know what it’s like? To pour your heart and soul into something, only to realize that no matter how hard you try, you’ll never measure up? Talent is talent, and hard work can only take you so far!” His chest heaves with barely contained fury, his breathing ragged as he forces himself to continue.

“Everyone abandoned me. Mocked me. Told me to accept my fate. Even Fang Zheng—my own brother, whom I raised after our parents died—even _he_ turned his back on me when I needed him most.” His voice cracks again, this time with raw emotion. “And my aunt and uncle? Their cruelty knew no bounds. They plotted against me, and Shen Chi, the current maid of Fang Zheng, I was naive and fall for their scheme and I never imagined that Shen Cui could have deceive me all that time, she actually never loved me and thanked to her cooperation with my aunt and uncle, I was framed and exiled from the clan. Finding no way, I left the village. Left the Gu Yue Clan.”

His tone shifts once more, growing colder, detached. “I wandered the wilderness, searching for opportunities. Surviving day by day. Do you know how hard it is to survive out there? How merciless the world can be?” He lets out a dark chuckle, his lips curling into a twisted smirk. “But I was lucky. Very lucky. I discovered methods to extend my lifespan. Over six hundred years, I roamed the earth, seizing every opportunity, climbing higher and higher until I reached the pinnacle of mortal world.”

His voice rises, triumphant yet tinged with madness. “I became immortal! Immortal!” He throws his head back, laughing wildly, the sound reverberating through the market like thunder. “And then… then I refined the legendary Immortal Gu Worm—the Spring Autumn Cicada. A worm capable of sending its user back in time.”

The laughter dies as quickly as it came, replaced by a chilling calmness. His gaze sharpens, piercing through the group like daggers. “But refining it came at a cost. Hundreds of thousands of lives… slaughtered. Sacrificed. All for the sake of power. And when I finally succeeded, the righteous forces of the world descended upon me. They cornered me, leaving me no escape. So I made my choice.” His voice drops to a whisper, icy and resolute. “I destroyed myself to use the Spring Autumn Cicada to return to the past. And it was a wonder to me that I came back to in time to the day before the Awakening Ceremony. And it was quite a long time, more than 600 years.”

He leans back, exhaling slowly, a manic grin spreading across his face. “And that… is only the beginning, ha ha ha.”

The silence that follows is deafening. Gu Xianer stares at him, her large eyes shimmering with awe and admiration. She doesn’t fully understand the gravity of his words, but she feels the weight of them nonetheless. To her, Fang Yuan is a hero—a figure larger than life.

Gu Wang and Yao Le, however, are frozen in place, their minds struggling to process the sheer enormity of what they’ve just heard. The fear in their hearts intensifies, mingling with disbelief and horror. This man—no, this _monster_ —is beyond comprehension. Beyond humanity.
