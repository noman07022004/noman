The morning air is **crisp**, carrying a lingering chill, yet the sky is painted in delicate hues of **orange and pink**, signaling the sun’s quiet ascent. The damp forest glistens with **morning dew**, the leaves trembling lightly in the breeze as if whispering secrets to one another.

Outside the small wooden house, **Fang Yuan stands still**, his black robe shifting faintly with the wind. His presence is **like an abyss—silent, unreadable, yet unfathomably deep**, pulling everything into its darkness. Gu Wang stands a few steps behind, her lips pressed into a thin line, her fists clenched.

This is it. **They are leaving.**

Then—**a voice, calm yet suffocating.**

**“Old Man Wang, Wang Er.”**

Fang Yuan’s words are neither loud nor soft, yet they **seep into the air, impossible to ignore.**

**“Come along.”**

A deathly silence follows.

Old Man Wang’s **wrinkled hands tremble.** Wang Er’s face **drains of all color, turning pale as lifeless ash.**

For a moment, neither of them move.

Fang Yuan sighs, shaking his head **with the air of a disappointed teacher.**

“Hmm? You’re hesitating?” His tone remains gentle, almost casual—**but the weight behind it presses down like an invisible force.** A faint smile tugs at his lips. “Could it be… you don’t want to come?”

His words are **soft**, yet they slither like a blade against bare skin.

Old Man Wang’s breath **catches.** His body stiffens.

“N-No! No, we will come!” He bows his head at once, his voice **unsteady, pitifully weak.**

Wang Er does not speak. **He simply starts walking.** Stiffly, mechanically—**like a puppet whose strings have been yanked forward.**

**“Hey! What’s wrong with you two?”**

Gu Wang’s sharp voice **cuts through the tension.**

She steps forward, glaring at Fang Yuan, her frustration bubbling over.

**“Why are you making them so scared? Can’t you just speak normally?”**

Fang Yuan turns to her, a teasing glint in his eyes.

**“Oh? And how exactly should I say it, dear Gu Wang?”** His voice shifts into an exaggerated, **mockingly dramatic** tone. **“Oh, my love, my life, the most beautiful soul in the world, please come with me~”**

Gu Wang **bristles.**

**“You—!!”**

Her face **flushes with irritation**, but she quickly **grits her teeth and whirls back** to her father and brother.

**“Don’t be afraid! Look at him! If you act scared, he’ll just enjoy it more—don’t you see it?! Why are you two such cowards today?!”**

Old Man Wang **keeps his head down.** Wang Er doesn’t **even react.**

Seeing their condition, Gu Wang feels a strange unease.

They aren’t just scared.

They are terrified.

---

The narrow mountain paths **wind and twist**, cutting through **dense forests** and overgrown bushes. The scent of damp earth lingers in the air, rich and fresh from the morning dew. Sunlight filters through the thick canopy, casting **dancing shadows** on the ground, while the chirping of birds and the rustling of unseen creatures fill the surroundings with a quiet, untamed melody.

Fang Yuan walks at a **leisurely pace,** his steps **light and unhurried**, as though he’s merely taking a pleasant stroll through his own backyard. **His robes flutter faintly**, their dark fabric standing in stark contrast to the golden hues of the forest.

Behind him, **Gu Xianer lags slightly**, her steps unsteady. **Her eyelids droop**, heavy with exhaustion. **Too much.** She has been through **too much** in just a few hours. The night before had been overwhelming, terrifying—a whirlwind of emotions she still doesn’t know how to process.

But thanks to **her brother’s madness**, she had **forgotten** about it, at least for a while.

Now, however, **fatigue crashes down on her like a wave.** Even keeping her eyes open feels like a battle. Her feet **drag** against the uneven ground, her body swaying slightly with every step.

She is so tired.

Fang Yuan, who has been walking ahead, suddenly halts.

He turns, eyes landing on her **with a gaze far too gentle, too warm.**

Then, in a voice as **soft as a spring breeze**, he says—

**“My precious princess, why don’t you get on my back? Your brother wants to enjoy the moment with you.”**

Gu Xianer **blinks.**

Her exhausted mind **halts.**

She stares at him in surprise, her drowsiness briefly forgotten. **A faint blush tints her cheeks.**

“I-I’m pretty heavy…” she murmurs hesitantly.

Fang Yuan’s expression **changes instantly.**

His eyes **widen dramatically**, and he **gasps loudly**, placing a hand over his heart as if she just **committed the greatest sin in history.**

“**Heavy?!**” he exclaims, as if utterly **offended.**

Gu Wang, walking beside them, nearly **trips** over a rock.

**What in the world…?**

Fang Yuan **shakes his head, sighing deeply, dramatically.** “How could my precious Xianer say such an **outrageous thing**?! Heavy?! My sister is lighter than the clouds! **Lighter than the wind!** In fact, are you sure you’re even real?! You might just float away if I let go!”

Gu Xianer **giggles**, covering her mouth. “Really?”

“Really!” Fang Yuan **nods firmly.** “Come, come! If you don’t get on now, your brother might just **cry from sadness**!”

Gu Xianer hesitates for only a moment longer before finally **climbing onto his back.**

Fang Yuan adjusts her effortlessly, standing up **straight as if she weighs nothing at all.** Gu Xianer lets out a soft sigh, her **small arms wrapping loosely** around his neck. Her warmth settles against him, and she nestles her cheek against his shoulder, her body **finally relaxing.**

Fang Yuan chuckles. “See? **Light as a feather!** No—**lighter than a feather!** Lighter than air! **My dear sister, are you even real?**”

Gu Xianer **bursts into laughter**, tightening her embrace around him.

**“You’re so warm, Brother,”** she murmurs sleepily. **“I feel really good here.”**

Fang Yuan’s **lips curl into a soft smile.**

“Of course you do, Xianer. Because **it’s your big brother.** You can ask me anytime for this.” He pauses, then **adds teasingly,** “Actually, from now on, you don’t even have to ask! If I see you tired, I’ll just pick you up! **No refusals allowed!**”

Gu Xianer **giggles again, burying her face into his shoulder.**

Gu Wang, who has been listening to the entire exchange, feels her mind **short-circuit.**

What is this?

How could someone like **him**—**a crazy madman**—act this way?

It is **too warm, too loving.** It doesn’t make sense.

Her chest feels **strange**, her emotions tangled and confused.

Without realizing it, she **starts picturing herself in Gu Xianer’s place.**

Fang Yuan’s arms carrying her securely, his teasing voice filling her ears, his warmth pressed against her back.

The image is so **vivid**, so **comforting**, that it makes her **heart skip a beat.**

And then—**her face burns.**

“**What am I thinking?!**” she scolds herself, shaking her head violently.

Her **frustration grows.**

She **glares at Fang Yuan’s back,** as if blaming him for these ridiculous thoughts.

Yet no matter how hard she tries, the **image doesn’t go away.**

---

For a while, they walk in **silence.**

The forest hums with life—**leaves rustle**, a gentle breeze weaves through the trees, and birds chirp in the distance. Yet, to Gu Xianer, the world feels **hushed**, as if holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

She clings to Fang Yuan’s back, her arms snug around his neck, her cheek pressed against his shoulder. **His warmth seeps into her**, comforting, steady. Safe.

Then, Fang Yuan speaks.

His voice is **gentle**, but beneath that light tone is a hint of **melancholy**.

“Xianer… my dear little sister… I need to tell you something important.”

Gu Xianer blinks drowsily, lifting her head slightly. “What is it, Brother?”

Fang Yuan pauses mid-step. He takes a **slow breath**, his grip on her thighs shifting slightly as he adjusts her on his back.

“I’ll be leaving the village soon,” he says softly. “Just for a little while. But I promise, I’ll come back to you.”

Gu Xianer’s **entire body stiffens.**

Her fingers clutch his robe, twisting the fabric.

Her breath catches in her throat.

Then—

**"N-No! Don’t leave me, Brother! Please… please don’t go!"**

Her voice cracks, raw and **desperate.**

Tears well up in her eyes, spilling down her cheeks like **shimmering raindrops.** She buries her face into his shoulder, sobbing quietly.

“**I swear, I’ll be obedient!**” she chokes out. “I won’t cause you any more trouble! I-I promise, Brother! So please—**please don’t leave me!**”

Fang Yuan **freezes.**

For the briefest moment, his mask of playfulness falters.

A strange **ache** grips his chest.

He had expected her to be sad. He had even prepared himself for some tears.

But this… this **desperation** in her voice.

It twists something deep inside him.

Fang Yuan **closes his eyes for a moment**, then turns his head slightly, pressing his cheek against hers. His voice drops to a whisper—**a promise, a reassurance, a quiet plea.**

“**Shh, shh, don’t cry, my precious princess…** I’m not leaving without a reason.”

Gu Xianer **sniffles**, her sobs **shaking against him.**

“**Then why?**” she whispers. “Why do you have to go…?”

Fang Yuan **hums thoughtfully.** Then, suddenly, his voice **brightens**, full of mischief.

“**How about this? You’ve always wanted to have a picnic in the clouds, right?**”

Gu Xianer hiccups, **blinking.**

She nods weakly.

Fang Yuan **grins.** “**Then I’ll go find a technique to make it happen!**”

Her grip loosens slightly. “Really…?”

“Really! And that’s not all.” His voice turns **playful, teasing.**

“I’ll also bring you a **cute little baby sun, moon, and stars** so you can play with them!”

Gu Xianer’s **red-rimmed eyes widen.**

“B-But how…?”

Fang Yuan gasps dramatically. “**How?** Xianer, Xianer, do you still not understand?” He laughs. “Because I am your brother! Your brother can fulfill **any wish**!”

Gu Xianer sniffles, but a **tiny smile** tugs at her lips.

Fang Yuan **points ahead.** “And you see that river over there?”

She peeks over his shoulder.

“**How about I bring you a rainbow bridge? We’ll place it over the river so we can walk across!**”

Gu Xianer’s **eyes sparkle.** “That sounds so fun!”

“Right?! And I’ll also bring a **bird that sings stories** and a **cloud whale so you can ride it through the sky!**”

Gu Xianer’s sadness **melts into wonder.**

Her arms tighten around him as she whispers, “**Brother… You always say the silliest things…**”

Fang Yuan chuckles. “**Silly? Hah! Just wait until I bring you a cloud soft enough to sleep on! You’ll regret doubting me!**”

Behind them, Gu Wang is **utterly stupefied.**

She doesn’t know whether to **laugh, cry, or slap Fang Yuan** for his **ridiculous lies.**

Yet, before she realizes it—**she’s imagining it.**

She **sees herself** sitting on a rainbow bridge, watching the sunrise with him.

She **sees herself** riding a cloud whale through the sky, laughing at his ridiculous antics.

Her chest **tightens.**

Damn it.

Why is she imagining herself in Gu Xianer’s place?

She shakes her head violently, **cursing herself** for thinking something so ridiculous.

Meanwhile, Gu Xianer clutches Fang Yuan’s robe even tighter.

Her voice is small, vulnerable.

“**You promise? You promise you’ll come back?**”

Fang Yuan **smiles.**

It is not his usual grin—**not teasing, not dramatic.**

It is **warm, tender.** A promise sealed in the depths of his soul.

“I promise, my precious little princess. I’ll be back before you know it.”

He lifts a hand and gently taps her nose, his voice warm, carrying a tenderness so soft it could melt the coldest of hearts. **“And until then, think of all the magical things we’ll do together. We’ll catch clouds, touch the stars, and have picnics in the sky.”**

Gu Xianer **sniffles, her little fingers tightening around his robe.** She doesn’t want to let go—not now, not ever. But then, a spark of excitement flickers through her teary eyes, like the first light of dawn breaking through a storm.

She suddenly **shouts, her voice trembling with both excitement and lingering sorrow,** “Then… then when you come back, bring me a tree that grows candy!!”

Fang Yuan’s **eyes soften, but his voice is full of dramatic cheer, as if her request is the grandest mission in the world.** **“Ah-ha! A most extraordinary request! I shall seek out the legendary Candy Blossom Tree, whose branches bloom with the sweetest treats, raining down chocolates and lollipops like petals in the wind!”**

Gu Xianer **sniffles again, but this time, her lips curl into a small, wobbly smile.** “Then I also want a pond, but instead of water, it should be filled with honey!”

Fang Yuan **nods sagely, as if she has just made a most profound wish.** “A **pond of honey**—a truly divine idea! And shall I bring you a little honey boat to sail across it? One made of gingerbread and lined with sugar pearls?”

Gu Xianer’s **eyes shine, a dreamy look crossing her face.** “Yes! And an entire lake of sweet milk so I can drink it whenever I want!”

Fang Yuan **gasps theatrically, as if her ideas are blowing his mind.** “A **lake of sweet milk!** I shall bring it to you in a golden goblet, fit for a princess like you! And you shall have a sugar straw to drink from it whenever your heart desires.”

Gu Xianer **laughs through her sniffles, wiping her teary eyes with her sleeve.** “I want a rainbow I can slide down from the sky!”

Fang Yuan **laughs, his voice dripping with mischief.** “The **Celestial Rainbow Slide**—a magnificent choice! I shall place one right at our doorstep, so we can slide straight into the clouds each morning, soaring through the sky like shooting stars!”

Gu Xianer’s **excitement builds, her sorrow momentarily forgotten.** “Then… Brother! I want a bunny that talks and tells me bedtime stories!”

Fang Yuan **places a hand over his heart, as if deeply moved.** “Fear not! I shall find the most **eloquent, bedtime-story-telling bunny in existence!** It shall tuck you in, read you the most magical tales, and even sing you lullabies as soft as moonlight.”

Gu Xianer **rests her head against his shoulder, sighing dreamily.** “And I want a pillow that floats, so I can sleep while drifting in the air…”

Fang Yuan **nods, his voice turning into a whisper, full of warmth.** “Ah… The **Dream Drifting Pillow.** Soft as the clouds, light as a feather… You will sleep as if the whole world is cradling you in its arms, floating like a star in the night sky.”

Gu Xianer **closes her eyes for a brief moment, imagining it all—the honey pond, the rainbow slide, the floating pillow. But then, her eyes flutter open again, and a new idea sparks in her mind.**

“Oh! My shadow always follows me, but it never plays with me! I want it to be my pet!”

Fang Yuan **laughs, a deep and genuine sound, full of amusement and adoration.** “A **pet shadow**? What a delightful thought! I shall teach it to **run, jump, and even fetch bones!** It shall play hide and seek with you, chase after butterflies, and dance whenever you command it!”

Their voices **mingle with the rustling of the leaves, weaving a symphony of laughter, wishes, and promises so grand that even the heavens would pause to listen.**

And finally, after **endless pleading, giggles, and reassurances**, Gu Xianer **sniffles one last time, burying her face against his shoulder, reluctant to let go.**

Her voice is soft, **fragile like a whisper in the wind.** “Okay… But if you don’t come back fast, I’ll be **very, very mad** at you…”

Fang Yuan’s **smile falters for a moment, his chest tightening with emotion.** He turns his head slightly, pressing a soft, lingering kiss to her forehead, his voice low, filled with an indescribable gentleness.

**“Of course… How could I ever make my precious little princess mad?”**

Gu Wang, who has been quietly following behind them, **feels like she’s losing her mind.**

At first, she had rolled her eyes at Fang Yuan’s ridiculous promises. A tree that grows candy? A pet shadow? A rainbow slide? **What kind of nonsense is this?!**

But the more she listens, the more she finds herself drawn in.

Gu Xianer’s voice, once choked with sobs, now rings with excitement. Her sorrow melts away like snow under the sun, replaced by childlike wonder. And Fang Yuan…

Fang Yuan, that unpredictable, terrifying, utterly insane demon—he speaks with such sincerity, such warmth, that Gu Wang almost believes him.

She clenches her fists. **No. This is absurd.**

And yet—

Somewhere deep in her heart, something stirs.

For a brief moment, she closes her eyes, **and she sees it.**

A world where a Candy Blossom Tree sways gently in the wind, its branches heavy with sweets. A pond of honey where golden waves ripple under the sunlight. A sky filled with drifting pillows, soft as clouds.

She sees herself standing on a rainbow bridge, the colors shimmering beneath her feet. She sees herself sailing across a lake of sweet milk, her hands dipping into its warmth.

She sees Fang Yuan beside her, laughing, teasing, effortlessly making the impossible feel possible.

Her chest tightens.

Damn it.

Why is she thinking about this?! **Why does it feel so… warm? So real?**

She grits her teeth, **shaking off the ridiculous thoughts.**

**This isn’t real.** This is just a demon’s trick. This is just childish nonsense.

And yet—

When she looks at Fang Yuan holding Gu Xianer so gently, when she hears the unshakable certainty in his voice as he promises to bring back the impossible,

**She finds herself wishing… just for a second… that it could be real.**

Meanwhile, **Old Man Wang and Wang Er continue walking like lifeless corpses.**

They are **horrified.**

**How can demons like them have this kind of love and emotion?!**

They do not understand.

And perhaps, they never will.

---

By the time they reach the outskirts of the jungle, Gu Xianer has drifted into a peaceful slumber on Fang Yuan’s back. Her soft, rhythmic breathing tickles his ear, her delicate fingers clutching his robe even in sleep. Fang Yuan carries her effortlessly, his steps light and unhurried, as if he were cradling the most precious treasure in the world.

He glances at her, his expression unreadable—**a mixture of amusement, tenderness, and something far deeper.**

“She looks happy, doesn’t she?” he murmurs, his voice gentle, more to himself than anyone else.

Gu Wang scoffs, crossing her arms. “Yeah, because you’ve managed to brainwash her with your ridiculous fantasies. She actually believes you’ll bring her all those absurd things.”

Fang Yuan smirks, unbothered. “And why not? Who’s to say I won’t?” He tilts his head slightly, his gaze drifting forward. “But more importantly… she’s smiling now. She’s not crying. She’s forgotten—at least for now—**the nightmare she lived through last night.**”

Gu Wang’s mocking expression falters.

Her hands tighten slightly at her sides as she looks at Gu Xianer’s peaceful face.

For a long moment, she says nothing.

**Maybe… just maybe… all of his madness, all of his exaggerated words, were never meant to deceive her. Maybe they were meant to save her.**

A warmth blooms in her chest—**confusing, unfamiliar.**

She sighs, shaking her head with a small, reluctant smile. “I have to admit… after spending this short time with you, I can’t say you’re all bad. You’re actually—” she hesitates, then exhales, “—a good brother.”

Fang Yuan **abruptly stops walking.**

He turns his head dramatically, his eyes widening as if he has just heard the most **scandalous** thing in existence.

“Who dares say I am a good person?! How dare you slander me like this?!” He clutches his chest in mock pain, then throws his head back with a wild grin. **“I am THE GREAT LOVE DEMON VENERABLE! My love is so vast, so boundless, that this mere world cannot contain it!**”

Gu Wang takes a step back, her face twisting in alarm. “W-What—”

Fang Yuan **leans in**, his voice dropping into a dramatic whisper.

“**Do you wish to receive a piece of my infinite love?**”

Gu Wang **freezes.**

Fang Yuan places a hand over his heart, his expression dead serious. “Alas, my love is too great! I can only offer you a tiny fragment… but you must cherish it forever. **Ah, what a tragic fate!**”

Gu Wang’s face **bursts into flames.**

Her ears turn red, her breath catches, and then—

“**W-WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! I DON’T WANT YOUR LOVE OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM YOU, YOU MANIAC!**”

Fang Yuan bursts into laughter, his voice ringing through the trees, carrying a mixture of **pure amusement and mischief.**

“**We’ll see about that!**” he teases, grinning. “Don’t regret it later, Little Wang! **Hahahaha!**”

Gu Wang **seethes, torn between strangling him and running away.**

And yet—

As she glares at him, her heart still pounding, she realizes something horrifying.

**Somewhere, deep in the most irrational part of her mind…**

**A tiny, treacherous voice whispers—**

_"What if he actually could bring those things? What if… just for a moment… I let myself believe?"_
