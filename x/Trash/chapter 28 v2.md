Fang Yuan’s performance ends as abruptly as it began. He closes his eyes, taking a deep breath, as if savoring the lingering echoes of his own madness. When he opens them again, they gleam with satisfaction—like an artist admiring their freshly painted masterpiece, still wet and glistening.

Then, Fang Yuan turns to Gu Xianer, his voice softening into something tender, almost reverent. His gaze melts into pure adoration, his lips curving into a smile so warm it could rival the sun itself.  
“So, my adorable little sister… How was the story? Did you enjoy it? ” he asks, tilting his head slightly, his tone dripping with affection, as though her opinion alone could make or break the universe.

Gu Xianer looks up at him, tears gathering in her large, innocent eyes. Her tiny hands clutch her dress tightly, trembling ever so slightly. She responds in a shaky voice, barely above a whisper.  
“It was… sad, ” she says softly, her lower lip quivering. “But also brave. The little sister was very strong. I liked her. ”

Fang Yuan’s grin widens impossibly further, his fingers reaching out to gently pinch her cheeks. His voice is playful, yet laced with exaggerated emotion, as if every word were a gift wrapped in gold.  
“Of course, she was strong! She was like you, my precious Xianer—a beacon of love and courage in a cruel world. Truly heroic! Truly magnificent! ” He leans closer, his tone growing softer, almost conspiratorial. “But don’t be upset, my sweet sister. Because of you, they’ve all been saved. ”

Gu Xianer blinks through her tears, her sadness momentarily forgotten.  
“Have I really saved them? How have I saved them? ” she asks, her wide eyes searching his face for answers.

Fang Yuan chuckles playfully, his expression lighting up with mischief.  
“You tamed the demon with your love, purity, and innocence, ” he declares, his voice filled with mock solemnity.

Gu Xianer’s eyes widen in awe.  
“Really?! ” she gasps, her voice brimming with wonder.

Fang Yuan nods gravely, his grin stretching ear to ear.  
“Because in that story, I was the demon. ” His gaze shifts suddenly, locking onto Gu Wang with piercing intensity. “The foolish, overconfident brother? Wang Er. The pathetic old man? Old Man Wang. And the fearless, righteous little sister… Was your friend, Gu Wang. ”

Silence blankets the room, thick and suffocating, as the weight of his words sinks in.

He leans down again, rubbing his cheek against hers affectionately, his voice trembling with exaggerated emotion.  
“Ohhh, look for you, my sweet sister! They’re all alive now. Thanks to your boundless love and grace! ” With a dramatic flourish, he points toward Gu Wang, Wang Er, and Old Man Wang, as if presenting them as trophies.

Gu Xianer giggles, clearly delighted by his antics, her tiny hands grabbing onto his sleeves.  
“Brother, stop squeezing my face! It tickles! ” she protests playfully, squirming under his teasing touch.

Meanwhile, Gu Wang stands nearby, visibly seething. Her fists clench so tightly that her knuckles turn white, and her jaw is locked as though she’s trying—and failing—to keep herself from exploding. Watching Fang Yuan dote on Gu Xianer with such overwhelming affection only adds fuel to her fury.

“ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?! ” she finally snaps, her voice sharp enough to cut steel. “You just told us this horrifying, twisted story about how you KILLED US ALL, and now you’re acting like it’s some kind of GAME?! ”

Fang Yuan turns to her, his warm, loving demeanor vanishing instantly. A teasing laughter bubbles forth, dark and mocking.  
“Why yes, dear Gu Wang, my eternal maid! What did you expect? Life is but a grand spectacle, and we are merely players in its endless drama. ”

Gu Wang’s temple throbs violently, her patience fraying to its absolute limit.  
“YOU’RE INSANE! COMPLETELY INSANE! THIS ISN’T A GAME! PEOPLE DIED IN THAT STORY—WE DIED! AND YOU ACT LIKE IT’S NOTHING! ”

Fang Yuan waves a dismissive hand, his grin returning as he squeezes Gu Xianer’s cheeks once more.  
“Don’t worry! That was in my past life when I had no adorable little sister to guide me. Back then, I was truly demonic. But now? To atone for my mistakes, I’ve allowed you the sacred status of THE GREAT LOVE DEMON VENERABLE’s first maid. HAHAHA! Isn’t that wonderful? ”

Fang Yuan notices Wang Er’s reaction and lets out a low chuckle, his grin widening even further.  
“Ah, look at poor Wang Er, ” he muses, his voice laced with cruel amusement. “Still shaking like a leaf. Don’t worry, my dear servant. That life is long gone. For now, at least. Unless, of course, you’d like me to recreate it here and now? ”

Wang Er’s pupils shrink, and he stumbles backward, nearly tripping over his own feet.  
“N-No… Please… Don’t… ” he stammers, his voice barely above a whisper.

Gu Wang whirls on Fang Yuan, her fury reaching new heights.  
“STOP TOYING WITH HIM! STOP TOYING WITH ALL OF US! YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?! ”

Fang Yuan throws his head back and laughs—a sound so unhinged, so full of madness, that it sends shivers down everyone’s spines.  
“HAHAHAHAHA! Oh, Gu Wang, you truly are a treasure! Your anger is like music to my ears! So passionate! So fiery! It’s like a divine song composed just for me! ”

Gu Xianer watches the chaos unfold with wide, confused eyes. She tugs gently on Fang Yuan’s sleeve, her small voice cutting through the tension.  
“Brother… Why is everyone so upset? Was the story really that bad? ”

Fang Yuan looks down at her, his expression softening once more. He pats her head gently, his voice filled with genuine affection.  
“Don’t worry, my sweet Xianer. They’re just jealous because they’ll never understand the depth of our bond. And how you’ve saved them, giving them what they could never imagine. You’ve turned this cruel world into something beautiful—all because of your love. ”

His smile grows softer, warmer, as he gazes at her with an intensity that borders on obsession.  
“You are my light, my salvation, my everything. Without you, I would still be lost in darkness. ”

And with that, Fang Yuan hugs her tightly, his laughter echoing into the night—a chilling symphony of madness and devotion, leaving everyone else caught between rage, disbelief, and sheer exhaustion.
