Inside Fang Yuan’s room, the atmosphere crackles with an electric intensity—a suffocating blend of warmth and dominance that seems to seep from every corner, not through any visible force but from the sheer weight of his presence. The air itself feels heavier, charged with a tension that makes it hard to breathe.

Fang Yuan hums softly, almost melodiously, as he gently lays Gu Xianer on the lavish bed, tucking her in with a tenderness that borders on obsessive. His hands move with exaggerated care, each gesture deliberate and absurdly gentle—so at odds with the unpredictable madness that usually defines him. It's as if he's performing some sacred ritual, one where even the slightest misstep could shatter the fragile balance of the moment. Then, his gaze drifts lazily toward Gu Wang, who stands frozen by the door, her wide eyes flickering between confusion, apprehension, and something akin to dread.

He tilts his head slightly, a bright, playful grin spreading across his face like sunlight breaking through storm clouds. But there’s no warmth in this light—it’s sharp, blinding, and utterly disarming.

"Why do you linger like a lost little rabbit, Gu Wang?" he asks, his voice dripping with teasing affection. "It's time for bed, my maid. You haven't slept a wink last night. Come, lie beside Gu Xianer."

Gu Wang flinches visibly, her fingers clutching the hem of her clothes so tightly they turn white. She stammers, struggling to form words under the weight of his piercing gaze.

"I—I'll be fine standing," she manages, her voice barely above a whisper. "I can sleep somewhere else—"

Fang Yuan gasps theatrically, clutching his chest as though struck by an invisible arrow. His expression shifts instantly, morphing into mock devastation.

"Oh? Rejecting my hospitality?" he laments, shaking his head with exaggerated sorrow. "Do you hate me, my Eternal Maid? After all, I so graciously carried you here!"

Her face twists in shock and indignation, her voice rising sharply.  
"N-No! And what?! Who is your eternal maid?! I came only to care for Gu Xianer—I am not your maid!"

Fang Yuan snaps his fingers with sudden realization, his eyes sparkling with wicked amusement. He leans forward slightly, his grin widening until it threatens to split his face.

"Ah, I see now—you’re nervous, aren’t you?" he purrs, his tone laced with condescension. "It must be overwhelming, beyond your feeble comprehension, to suddenly become the First Maid of Me, The Great Love." His voice swells with pompous grandeur, each word delivered with the flair of a divine proclamation. "Sleeping in the same bed as me as my maid must feel daunting. But fear not—you will adapt. In time, you'll learn what it truly means to serve me."

Gu Wang stares at him, utterly baffled, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water.  
"What… are you even talking about?!"

Fang Yuan chuckles softly, his tone softening just enough to retain its edge of mischief. He steps closer, his movements fluid and predatory, his eyes dancing with a teasing glint that sends a chill down her spine.

"If the bed feels too intimidating," he murmurs, leaning in just a fraction more, "there’s always another option."

Still flustered, Gu Wang blinks in confusion, her mind struggling to keep up with his rapid shifts in mood and meaning.  
"H-Huh?"

With a devilish smirk, Fang Yuan leans in further, his voice dropping to a slow, deliberate whisper that reverberates through the room like a forbidden promise. Each syllable drips with wicked amusement, designed to unravel her composure thread by thread.

"My embrace is warm, soft, and incredibly inviting," he drawls, savoring the way her cheeks flush crimson. "Would you like to try it?"

Gu Wang’s entire face erupts in a deep, fiery red, her body stiffening as if struck by lightning. Her mind seizes, her thoughts scattering like leaves in a hurricane.  
"Wha—?! W-Who would ever—?!"

Fang Yuan bursts into uncontrollable laughter, his eyes crinkling with delight as he revels in her mortification. He leans in again, his grin turning provocatively playful, his voice dripping with feigned innocence.

"Hahaha! Look at you—your face is redder than a roasted pig!" he teases, his tone shifting seamlessly into something darker, more suggestive. "Could it be… that you were thinking about how to get a baby out of me?" He pauses, letting the implication hang heavy in the air before adding with a smirk, "Truly, you are a vicious woman!"

Gu Wang jerks back so violently that she nearly trips over her own feet, her hands flying up instinctively as if to shield herself from his words.  
"WHAT?!" she shrieks, her voice cracking under the strain of raw embarrassment and fury. "I—I WOULD NEVER THINK SOMETHING SO—SO—!"

Her voice falters, choked off by the heat burning in her cheeks. She grits her teeth, her fists clenched so tightly her nails dig into her palms. Fury and humiliation war within her, battling for dominance.

"Who in their right mind would entertain such thoughts? Don’t just spout any nonsense that comes to mind!" she snaps, her voice trembling with barely contained rage.

Fang Yuan gasps dramatically, placing a hand over his heart as though wounded. His expression morphs into one of mock betrayal, his eyes wide with exaggerated hurt.

"Oh, how cruel you are," he laments, shaking his head with theatrical disappointment. "I was looking forward to a warm, soft little pillow tonight, and you…" He clicks his tongue, his tone dripping with false reproach. "You were entertaining all those wicked ideas. How can a good, gentle, innocent, loving girl have such dirty thoughts? I’m truly disappointed in you, Gu Wang."

Gu Wang stares at him, her disbelief mingling with a simmering anger that threatens to boil over. She takes a deep, shuddering breath, trying—and failing—to steady herself.

Then Fang Yuan leans in even closer, his tone shifting abruptly from playful to grave, though still laced with that familiar teasing lilt. His voice drops lower, almost conspiratorial, as if sharing a dark secret meant only for her ears.

"I believe when I mentioned a baby, your thoughts took a dark turn—something so terrible I dare not even name it!" His face momentarily falls into a sorrowful mask, his eyes glistening with feigned pain. "I expected you to guide my Xianer towards goodness, to teach her pure things... but you, you are such a bad girl."

Her eyes widen, and for a moment, anger and humiliation surge in her voice, raw and unfiltered.  
"You..." she begins, her words trembling with a mix of rage and sorrow, before she abruptly turns on her heel and storms toward the bed. Without a backward glance, she yanks the blanket over herself, curling up as far away from him as possible.

Fang Yuan watches her retreat with a fox-like grin, his eyes gleaming with triumph and satisfaction. He tilts his head slightly, his voice soft and dripping with playful mockery.

"Such a good girl..." he murmurs, his tone laced with smug amusement as he surveys her shivering form beneath the blanket. "See? The bed isn’t so bad after all, is it?"

Gu Wang refuses to answer, her entire body burning with humiliation and indignation. She buries her face deeper into the pillow, willing herself to disappear.

With a final, knowing chuckle, Fang Yuan turns away, his mischievous smile never wavering. Teasing is his art, and the thrill of watching her flustered vulnerability is his greatest delight. He savors the moment, relishing the chaos he has wrought.

In the oppressive silence that follows, exhaustion finally overtakes Gu Wang, and despite the lingering blush on her face, she drifts into a fitful sleep. Her breathing evens out, though her brow remains furrowed, as if even in slumber she cannot escape the turmoil he has inflicted upon her.

Fang Yuan, meanwhile, sits back with a satisfied, almost predatory smile, savoring the power of his playful words. His gaze lingers on her sleeping form, his expression unreadable yet undeniably pleased.

After all… there is nothing more entertaining than a flustered, helpless girl ensnared in his web.
