Fang Yuan **claps his hands together**, his eyes gleaming like a **lunatic who just discovered the secret to immortality.**

"**Gu Wang! Get ready. We are leaving in a few moments!**"

But before the words can even settle—

"**I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE! AND I AM NOT YOUR MAID ANYMORE, YOU CRAZY MADMAN!**"

Gu Wang’s **furious voice cuts through the air like a blade.**

Fang Yuan **freezes.**

The **gleam in his eyes vanishes.**

The **world itself seems to pause.**

Then—**his body shudders violently, as if her words have struck him with divine retribution.**

His **expression twists in sheer, gut-wrenching agony.** His **breath hitches, his pupils shake.**

"**N-No… NO! It can’t be… IT CAN’T BE!**"

He **stumbles backward**, arms clutching his chest as though he has been **stabbed through the heart.**

His lips **tremble**, his **breathing ragged.** Then—**a single tear falls.**

Followed by another.

And another.

**A torrential waterfall of despair.**

"**Oh my maid… my eternal, devoted, FAITHFUL maid… HOW COULD YOU?!**"

His voice **quivers, cracking with heartbreak.**

"**I CHOSE YOU! Out of all the pitiful mortals in this miserable world, I—ME! The Great Love Demon Venerable!—blessed you! Elevated you! Raised you above all others!**"

His hands **claw at his hair as if he is losing his sanity.**

"**And yet… THIS?! THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?!**"

He **stumbles back again, collapsing against a tree.**

"**You throw it away? Just like that? Like a useless piece of trash?!**"

His **chest rises and falls rapidly, gasping.**

Then—**his eyes darken.**

The trembling **stops.**

The tears? **Gone.**

The despair? **Erased.**

His voice **becomes quiet, low, almost sinister.**

"**Loyalty… devotion… were they all a lie?**"

Then, suddenly—**his head snaps to Gu Xianer.**

His gaze **softens—unnaturally so.**

The sorrow melts into something **gentle, coaxing, deceiving.**

With a deep, **suffering sigh,** he kneels beside her, taking her **tiny hands into his own.** His fingers gently stroke her palms, his tone **whispering, hypnotic.**

"**Xianer… my beloved, my precious, my innocent little sister… have you seen? Have you understood now?**"

Gu Xianer **blinks, confusion clouding her innocent gaze.**

Fang Yuan **shakes his head, voice filled with soft regret.**

"**There is no one for you except me. No one, Xianer.**"

He **sighs, heavy and sorrowful.**

"**Even the one who promised to teach you how to cook… has already abandoned you.**"

Gu Xianer’s **small fingers tremble.**

"**She doesn’t care about you, Xianer.**"

His **eyes grow colder.**

"**She doesn’t want you to be happy.**"

Tears **well up in Gu Xianer’s large, innocent eyes.**

She turns to Gu Wang, her voice fragile, trembling, breaking.

"**Aren’t you coming with us?**"

A pause.

Then, **her voice cracks.**

"**Aren’t you going to teach me cooking?**"

Her **eyes glisten.**

"**Do you… do you really hate me?**"

Gu Wang’s **heart clenches.**

"**NO!**" she blurts out immediately. "I love you very much! I will teach you cooking, I swear!"

Then—**Fang Yuan’s face changes.**

The **broken, grieving man disappears.**

His **expression goes blank.**

Emotionless. Empty.

His **eyes flicker.**

"**Ah… I see.**"

He **turns to Old Man Wang.**

The **playful lunatic is gone.**

What stands before them now is **not a man.**

Not a brother.

Not a performer.

But something **darker.**

A **presence so suffocating, so absolute**, that the very air grows still.

Fang Yuan’s voice drops into **a low, chilling whisper.**

"**Old Man Wang.**"

Old Man Wang **stiffens immediately.**

Fang Yuan **steps forward, the weight of his presence pressing down like an avalanche.**

His voice remains **calm. Too calm.**

The kind of calm that **precedes absolute destruction.**

"**Your daughter… has achieved something beyond your wildest imagination.**"

His **gaze locks onto Gu Wang, unreadable.**

"**She has been chosen.**"

A slow, deliberate pause.

Then—**his lips curl into an empty, chilling smile.**

"**She is now the First Maid of The Great Love Demon Venerable.**"

The world **seems to freeze.**

Old Man Wang **stares, body rigid with terror.**

"**You should be proud. Oh, how honored you should feel!**"

Then—**his smile remains, but his presence darkens.**

"**And of course… you are afraid.**"

His head tilts.

His voice **lowers into an amused whisper.**

"**You should be afraid.**"

Silence.

Then—**he claps his hands together, breaking the suffocating tension.**

"**Now! Make your daughter ready. And prepare your son as well.**"

Old Man Wang **stares, paralyzed.**

"**He is coming with us. After all, he must know where his sister is going. And he should be able to visit her anytime, don’t you agree?**"

His **smile is too gentle.**

Too kind.

Too **dangerous.**

"**I am giving you three some time to discuss. But do not make me wait.**"

Then—**his voice drops into a whisper so soft it barely exists.**

"**You don’t want me to repeat the fate of your family again… do you?**"

Old Man Wang’s **face drains of all color.**

He **nods, trembling.**

"**Y-Yes… Great Love…**"

Then—

"**WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! WHY ARE YOU SCARING MY FATHER?! DO YOU THINK THIS IS A JOKE?!**"

Gu Wang’s **furious voice breaks the silence.**

Fang Yuan **blinks.**

Then—**his lips curl.**

His **eyes gleam.**

His smile—**teasing, playful, charming, maddening.**

"**Oh?**"

He **steps forward, eyes locked onto Gu Wang.**

"**It seems… an angel has fallen from heaven.**"

His **voice turns velvety, sweet like poisoned honey.**

"**She keeps coming back to me, again and again, singing the same melody of rage and frustration.**"

Then—**he gasps.**

His **hand flies to his chest.**

"**Oh no… oh no! Could it be?!**"

His eyes widen in **mock realization.**

Then—**he takes a step closer.**

His voice **lowers, teasing, intimate.**

"**Gu Wang… have you…**"

He leans in.

"**Fallen for me?**"

Silence.

Then—**he erupts into laughter.**

"**HAHAHAHAHAHA! A MAID FALLING FOR HER MASTER! HOW SCANDALOUS! HOW DANGEROUS! HOW BEAUTIFULLY TRAGIC!**"

Gu Wang’s **face burns red—not from embarrassment, but from sheer, uncontrollable rage.**

Fang Yuan **laughs again, watching her with mirthful delight.**

"**Ah… silence with that cute, furious face.**"

His **smirk deepens.**

"**Truly, the sweetest sight of all.**"

Gu Wang’s **fury explodes** like a storm, her fists clenched so tight her knuckles turn white. Her voice **shakes with frustration**, but her words come out like knives—sharp, cutting.

"**YOU! You lunatic! You absolute menace! HOW CAN SOMEONE LIKE YOU EXIST?!**"

Fang Yuan **gasps dramatically**, **staggering back as if struck by a divine revelation.**

His eyes widen. **His hands tremble.** Then—**he clutches his head, his expression twisting into sheer, exaggerated horror.**

"**OH NO!**"

His voice **drops to a whisper, filled with eerie realization.**

"**Could it be…? Have I…?**"

Then—**he SCREAMS.**

"**HAVE I TRANSCENDED HUMANITY?!**"

He **throws his arms wide, his entire body trembling as if possessed by an unspeakable truth.** His eyes glow with **wild, frenzied light.**

"**AM I NO LONGER A MERE MORTAL, BUT SOMETHING GREATER?! A FORCE BEYOND COMPREHENSION?! A BEING SO PERFECT, SO MAGNIFICENT, SO UNMATCHABLE THAT THE VERY LAWS OF EXISTENCE TREMBLE BEFORE ME?!**"

He **drops to his knees, shaking his head in disbelief, muttering to himself.**

"**No, no, no… it makes sense now. It all makes sense. My beauty, my genius, my boundless charm—of COURSE they would defy logic! The heavens could never create something so flawless on purpose.**"

Then—**his head SNAPS UP.**

His **mad grin stretches wider.** His eyes lock onto Gu Wang like **a predator toying with prey.**

"**Tell me, Gu Wang… have you come to this realization as well? Is that why you keep coming back to me, my little melody of rage? Hm? Hmmm?!**"

He **leans in, voice dropping into a dark, teasing purr.**

"**Could it be that… you’ve fallen for me?**"

Gu Wang **stares at him, stunned into silence.**

Then—**she SNAPS.**

"**FALL FOR YOU?! YOU—?!**"

Her **face burns red, veins popping on her forehead.** She raises her hand as if she’s about to **SLAP this absolute lunatic into another dimension.**

But before she can, **Fang Yuan moves.**

He **flinches back with exaggerated fear, his entire body trembling like a delicate maiden.**

"**AH! VIOLENCE! HELP! HELP! A WEAK, FRAGILE MAID IS ATTEMPTING TO STRIKE ME!**"

He **hides behind Gu Xianer**, clutching her shoulders dramatically, his voice quivering with fake innocence.

"**Xianer! My pure, gentle, adorable little sister! Did you see that?! Your ruthless, cruel, tyrannical COOKING TEACHER just tried to ATTACK me!**"

Gu Xianer **blinks, completely lost.**

"**Eh?**"

"**I—I was just standing here, minding my own business, quietly accepting the pain of my heart being shattered into a million pieces, AND YET SHE WANTS TO HIT ME?!**"

He **clutches his chest, gasping weakly.**

"**Xianer… Xianer, my beloved sister… do you see now? Do you see the kind of person she really is? A VILLAIN! A HEARTLESS MONSTER! A WRETCHED, EVIL FIEND!**"

Gu Xianer’s **eyes dart between Gu Wang and Fang Yuan, completely bewildered.**

"**B-But… Big Sister Wang is kind…**"

Fang Yuan **gasps sharply, eyes widening as if he has just been BETRAYED.**

He **stares at Gu Xianer, hands shaking, lips parting in sheer devastation.**

"**Xianer… my… my own sister… d-defending her…?**"

His voice **quivers, breath hitching like he’s about to cry.**

"**Am I… Am I truly alone? Has my world crumbled?**"

Then—**his body SWAYS.**

He **collapses onto the ground, gripping his own throat, struggling for breath.**

"**No… no, no, no… my heart… my heart is breaking… I—I CAN’T BREATHE!**"

Gu Xianer **panics immediately.**

"**B-Brother?! BROTHER?!**"

She **drops down beside him, grabbing his arm.**

Fang Yuan **coughs weakly**, his **entire body trembling like a man on his deathbed.**

"**S-So cold… the world is so cold… My own sister… siding with my maid… The betrayal… I—I’m dying, Xianer… I’m really dying…**"

Gu Xianer **immediately looks at Gu Wang with teary eyes.**

"**Big Sister Wang! Please apologize to my brother! He’s dying!**"

Gu Wang **looks at the situation unfolding before her, then at Fang Yuan—who is CLEARLY faking all of this.**

Her **eye twitches violently.**

Then—**she SCREAMS.**

"**I’M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!**"

Fang Yuan **SPRINGS UP LIKE A RESURRECTED GOD.**

"**AH-HA! SHE CONFESSES HER INTENTIONS! WITNESSES! DID YOU HEAR?! MY ADORABLE MAID WANTS TO KILL ME!**"

Gu Wang **lunges at him, but Fang Yuan DODGES, LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.**

His **voice echoes through the air, full of wild, uncontrollable mirth.**

"**HAHAHAHAHA! OH, WHAT A TRAGEDY! OH, WHAT A LOVE STORY! A MAID WHO HATES HER MASTER! A BROTHER BETRAYED! A SISTER FORCED TO CHOOSE!**"

He **spins dramatically, pointing at Gu Wang.**

"**Truly! If this were a play, it would be the greatest tragedy of our time! Or… a comedy!**"

He **grins—sharp, manic, dazzling.**

"**Either way, I LOVE IT!**"

Gu Wang, **breathing heavily, completely out of patience, glares at him.**

"**I swear… I swear on everything I have… I am going to throw you into a pit and bury you alive!**"

Fang Yuan **gasps, deeply touched.**

"**Ah, such devotion…**"

He **places a hand over his heart, eyes shimmering with ‘emotion.’**

"**She wants to bury me… personally. She cares so much that she doesn’t even want to leave my corpse unattended.**"

Then—**he SIGHS, shaking his head.**

"**But alas, Gu Wang, you may not bury me so easily. I am eternal, after all. The Great Love Demon Venerable cannot be defeated by mere soil!**"

He **grins again, eyes flashing.**

"**So instead of wasting your time, you should simply accept your fate. Come, my adorable maid, let us depart! The world awaits our presence!**"

Gu Wang **looks like she’s about to have a stroke.**

Fang Yuan **laughs again, throwing an arm around Gu Xianer.**

"**Ah, but first, a walk with my beloved sister. You three, discuss quickly—I have no patience for delays!**"

Then, **without waiting for a response, he cheerfully pulls Gu Xianer away, leaving Gu Wang and Old Man Wang in stunned silence.**

Gu Wang **trembles.**

She takes a deep breath.

And then—

"**AAAAAAAAAHHHH!**"

Her **furious scream echoes through the forest.**
