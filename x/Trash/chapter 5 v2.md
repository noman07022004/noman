At the evening, in Fang Yuan's uncle's house, servants are busy preparing many dishes for the celebration of having two high rank talent awakening. Fang Yuan's [[Dong Tu|uncle]] and aunt are also very busy with many works as if their children has awaken high grade talent. Fang yuan's uncle says to his aunt, "I thought that they would be talentless and even if they have talent, I thought that Fang Yuan would be the most talented and then Fang Zheng and Gu Xianer would be talentless.

It looks like the fate is really mysterious and it has made Gu Xianer the most talented one and Fang Yuan the most untalented one. 

From now one, we have to act kind and gentle towards Gu Xianer. Even if she eats the meal of 5 adult males, you have to give her while saying gentle words like you should eat more as Gu Master has a big apatite. You also have to show them that we are giving our best. 

We will eat less in front of them from today onward to show them that even we are ready to sacrifice our meal for theirs. And you also need to behave in a way that you have been considering them your own child. We can't let them understand that their parents have left a big inheritance for them. Their parents were rank three and the value of their inheritance is at least one hundred thousand. Your mission today is to make Gu Xianer eat with us in dining table. We can't let Gu Xianer eat with Fang Yuan in his room. Do you understand?"
Aunt responds, "Don't worry.  What do you think who I am? Don't you think your wife can't even do this things. Don't you believe in your wife."
Uncle responds, "It is not like I don't believe in you. It is just that we can't afford to do any mistake."











After a few moments in Fang Yuan's room, Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer are sitting near the windows and looking at the moon and starts. Fang Yuan is telling her stories. Suddenly, Gu Xianer shouts, "Brother, now that we have become Gu Master. When will we become high and mighty immortal who can tear through the heaven and touch the moon?"
Fang Yuan responds, "We will soon become immortal and your brother will take you to the moon. Do you want to hear the story of mortals who touch the moon?"
Gu Xianer shouts with excitement, "Can mortal really touch moon! I want to know more. Tell me the story."
Then Fang Yuan starts telling her the story of how the people of earth, even being a lowly mortal, uses technology to touch the moon.
Suddenly their aunt enters the room while Fang Yuan is telling her the story. 
Their aunt says, "Gu Xianer, you are tired as you have worked really hard. The meal is ready. I have prepared special meal for you as you celebration on become a high talented Gu Master."

Gu Xianer responds, "Ok, I will come after sometime after finishing the story."
Aunt says, "Today is special food. Very yammie. You have never eaten this in you entire life."
It looks like is has no effect on Gu Xianer. It looks like that she is not interested in eating anymore. In reality, Even if she feels intense hunger and greed for food, she would prefer to starve with Fang Yuan. Suddenly, Fang Yuan says with a gloomy voice, "Gu Xianer, you have done very good today. You should go and eat with your heart content."

It is not that Fang Yuan is jealous of their success. It is just that it reminds him of his own failure. When he has heard that their aunt and uncle are preparing good food to celebrate the success of Gu Xianer and Fang Zheng for become Gu Master with high talent, he feels intense pain which can never be describe within word. The pain of one's own failure. 

Gu Xianer says, "Then I will go and bring our food here. You feel me while completing the story."
Hearing this, Aunt says, "You don't have to eat in this room anymore with Fang Yuan alone. You can join with us. You can have as much as you want. You have become a Gu Master so you have to eat a lot to become stronger."
Gu Xianer tries to reject the idea but Fang Yuan says, "Let go and eat with them. It is really enjoyable to eat with family member in the same table."

Even though Fang Yuan tries to hide his pain and sorrow of his own failure as much as he can but it makes him look even more gloomy and pitiful. 

Suddenly, a phrase begins to echo in his mind:
***"Your loved one's success may fill your heart with warmth, pride, and happiness, but the brilliant light of their achievement casts a deep, dark shadow, relentlessly reminding you of your own failures. The more you smile for them, the more that shadow grows, echoing in your chest and amplifying the quiet ache within your soul. It's as though every spark of joy you feel for them fans the flames of your own unspoken sorrow."***

In the dining room, Uncle, aunt, Fang Yuan, Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer are eating together where all the servant are busy serving them. Gu Xianer can't eat properly by her own hand because she can't even recall when she last eat by herself. She can only recall Fang Yuan feeding her. Seeing her struggling eating with her own hand, Fang Yuan starts teaching her how to do it by showing practically. 

Fang Zheng along with Aunt and Uncle feel annoyed. Aunt and uncle are even more frustrated thinking that from now on they have to act gently before Gu Xianer. 

Aunt can't pretend anymore and shouts, "Gu Xianer, don't you even know how to eat by your own hand. Do you want to take your brother to your in-law's house to feed you?" 

Seeing this, uncle ponders, "She can't even control her frustration. I have told her to pretend to act gentle before her as we need to make them feel that we are their parents. Otherwise, we won't be able to take their inheritance that is left by their parents. No problem. It looks like I need to manipulate them and take control of the situation."

Then, uncle gives a gentle smile and says, "Don't get angry. She is learning and Gu Xianer, you don't have to feel bad on your aunt's comment. She is just like your mother as a mother can't tolerate her daughter shortcoming. In reality, she loves you very much and want to make you a perfect wife and women. We are just like you parents. We want our children to become perfect without a flaw. So, we teach you in this way. Even though, this might look harsh on surface but beneath the surface there is only love."

Gu Xianer freezes on her table as she hasn't been treated like this during meal for a very very long time. She has been eating in Fang Yuan's room for many years as long as she can recall. During their meal, Fang Yuan always feeds her and tells her many stories. So, she has forgotten how they used to treat her during meal and what was the main reason of Fang Yuan to eat separately in his room with her. Suddenly she recalls a memory. In the memory:

---
She sees the same table full of foods before her. She can't control herself and starts eating. Without her knowing, she has finished two plates and started another. Suddenly, Aunt comes with uncle and starts shouting while grabbing her neck tightly, "What have you don't? You have already finished this one plate which was for your uncle and now the second plate whish was for me. You brainless pig!"

Hearing the shouts of aunt, Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng rush towards the dining room.

Seeing Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng, aunt shouts, "Look, what have your brainless sister done? Today, your uncle has special meeting. So, I have prepared this plate of meal specially for him. Not only has she eaten this plate of special meal that I have prepared for your uncle. She has also finished the plate of meal that I have prepared spicially for myself."

Without hearing anything, Fang Yuan quickly rushes toward Gu Xianer when he sees that aunt is grabbing her neck tightly with one hand and using her other hand to press her cheeks tightly. She is crying from intense pain but can't create any sound for her aunt's tight grip. Fang Yuan quickly takes Gu Xianer from her aunt's grasp. And starts rubbing her neck and cheeks while saying may comforting words.

Hearing aunt, Fang Zheng shouts, "What have you done! Can't you even recognize which plate is prepared for you and how can you even devour this much food. Were you really a hungry beast in your previous life!"

Uncle says, "How can you behave like this, Gu Xianer! Who will marry you if you behave in this way?"

Hearing all these, Gu Xianer's pain intensifies and she cries even more which makes Aunt, uncle and Fang Zheng annoyed.

Aunt orders with anger to the servants, "Never let Gu Xianer eat anything without my permission. If I find out she is eating in secret, you all will see what would I do to you."

All the servants responds affirmatively.

Fang Yuan says, "Aunt, you don't have to worry. I will teach her everything properly. You all please finish you meal and don't need to worry about me as I am not feeling hunger today."

Afterward, Fang Yuan takes her to his room. After going to his room, Fang Yuan make her sit on the bed. Gu Xianer is still trembling from fear and pain. She is even more fearful thinking his brother is going to beat her. She is trembling from fear thinking about her fate.

But to her surprise, Fang Yuan doesn't even talk about her crime rather he starts rubbing her neck and cheeks with cold water and says, "Don't worry. This pain will soon disappear. How can aunt do this to you!"

Fang Yuan can't say any word as he feels suffocation and tears starts pouring out of his eyes as he says, "Every single finger is still visible! How can aunt do it to you, a child! And even more how can uncle enjoy seeing this without preventing her."

After saying that, Fang Yuan embraces Gu Xianer tightly as his tears are flowing like stream. Gu Xianer also tightly embraces Fang Yuan as she is crying.

---

Gu Xianer snaps out of her memory by her aunt's call. But she again starts remembering many insult like: "You brainless hungry pig." "Devouring monster." "Mindless hungry beast." "Who will marry this pig?" "Even pig might not marry her."

Suddenly she hears her aunt's voice saying, "So, do you understand? I want the best for you. I am just like you mother. You will understand my feeling when you get married and have your own children."

Again, hearing the words like 'marriage', 'husband' many cruel words echo in her ears: 'Who would marry you?' 'Not even a pig would marry her.' 'Her husband would be poor just feeding her.' 'I feel sorry for her husband.' The laughter rings in her mind: 'He he he!' 'Ha ha ha!' 'He he ha ha!' 'He he he ha ha ha!'

She can't take it any more and shouts while crying, "My big brother will marry me." Then she looks at Fang Yuan in a way as if she is saying, "I know I am not a good girl. I am not worth of you. But please, accept me. There is no one for me except you in this world. I will learn everything. I will obey everything you would say. Please, don't reject me."

Everyone including Fang Yuan become confused and shocked. Because, the situation was very normal. Aunt and uncle were giving advise and telling their nephew how much they loved their nephew. Even more aunt and uncle were saying things like how their aunt and uncle are their parents and how they had been loving them in disguise.

Fang Yuan has never seen this face of Gu Xianer. It looks extremely hopeless as well as extremely hopeful at the same time. Without thinking anything, Fang Yuan responds, "Ok, I will marry you."

Hearing Fang Yuan's responds, Gu Xianer shouts with excitement while crying, "Haven't I told you before that my brother will marry me. I don't need anyone else. My brother is enough for me. I know my brother will never abandon me."

Everyone including Fang Yuan are totally on confusion and shock. They can't find out what is wrong with Gu Xianer. And yet, a thought echoes in Fang Yuan's mind, a truth he can no longer ignore:

***"Each harsh word is a seed of dark shadow; each cruel phrase deepens it with every echo. Over time, the shadow consumes, leaving the mind so fragile that even kindness feels like a blow. Be mindful of the shadows you create, for they may linger far longer than you intend—casting darkness even in the light of your intentions."***
