After a few day, during a class, the academy elder shouts, "Now, do you understand why your vital Gu worm is important."

A student shouts, "Elder, can't I change my vital Gu worm in the future if I want to?"

Academy elder responds, "It is possible but it is a complex process. In this process, the vital Gu worm might die and you might also get injured. But If you find a more suitable Gu worm for you in the future, you can change it but you should remember the higher your cultivation, the harder and complex to change vital Gu worm."

Hearing this, Fang Zheng ponders, "I have decided [[Blood Derivation Gu Worm]] be my vital Gu worm. It is not possible to get this Gu worm right now. It is really a powerful Gu Worm but to refine it I not only need to sacrifice someone with highest pure blood but also half of my own blood. But it is worth it. It looks like I need to execute my plan properly. For now, I will take the basic Gu worm of my village. After absorbing the Flower Wing Monk's inheritance, I will refine Blood Derivation Gu Worm. Otherwise, I might face many difficulties and there is high chance that my plan would fail. It is really good that there is a blood path inheritance in the Gu Yue Village where the founder of Gu Yue Clan is hibernating. I will also use you properly. He he he."

Suddenly, academy elder shouts, "Today, you will choose your first Gu worm. Now, form a line and follow me quietly." Afterward, everyone follows the elder's instruction and picks their first Gu Worm.

After a few moments, Fang Yuan asks Gu Xianer, "What types of Gu Worm have you chosen?"

Gu Xianer responds, "Brother, I have chosen a healing type Gu Worm. I will heal you if you get injured or ill. What about you?"

Fang Yuan responds, "I have chosen a movement type Gu Worm. If there is any casualties in the future, your brother will take you to safety by using this Gu Worm. And you can use your healing Gu Worm to heal me if I get injuries."

After a few days, in the classroom, the Academy elder announces, "Gu Xianer was the first to refine the Gu worm, Fang Zheng came second, and the rest follow in order."



Fang Yuan stands at the very end of the line, his position marking him as the last. Gu Xianer's divine physique had allowed her to refine the Gu Worm with impressive speed, securing her the top spot. However, the irony of her situation is clear—while her cultivation advancement will be slower than even Fang Yuan's, her divine physique compensates by granting her strength surpassing that of an extreme physique.

"Look, that’s Fang Yuan—the one with only D-grade talent, while his brother and sister both have A-grade talent," someone whispers, their tone dripping with disdain.

"Can you believe it? Everyone in our class has already advanced to Rank 1 middle stage. The Academy elder even extended the time more than once, but Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer are still stuck," another voice chimes in.

"I heard his sister loves him dearly, always defending him, but look at how he repays her kindness," a student scoffs.

"Such a curse," someone else mutters. "He’s holding his sister back. If it weren’t for him, she would’ve been the first to advance to the middle stage."

Gu Xianer steps forward, her voice firm despite the whispers swirling around the room. "Stop saying bad things about my brother! It’s not his fault, and it’s none of your business anyway!" she declares, her gaze sharp as it sweeps over the murmuring students.

But before she can say more, Fang Yuan gently pulls her back by the arm. But before he can say anything. He again loses his control over his body and Demonic Fang Yuan takes control of his body and then release killing intent toward Gu Xianer. After a few millisecond, Naive Fang Yuan again gains back his control automatically.

His face looks extremely pale as if there is no life left. He tries to breath but he feels like his breathing has stopped. For the past three months, Demonic Fang Yuan has been seizing control of his body, attempting to kill Gu Xianer again and again. The thought terrifies him, leaving him in a constant state of fear and helplessness.

The toll on his mind is evident. He should have advanced to Rank 1 middle stage long ago, but his mental state is in complete disarray, shackling his cultivation progress. Fear and exhaustion grip him, leaving him on the edge of collapse.

After a few moments, the Academy elder enters the classroom, his stern gaze sweeping over the students. He claps his hands, calling for attention. "Report your progress," he commands, his voice calm but expectant.

As the students take turns, his expression remains composed—until his eyes fall on Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer. His brow furrows as he processes the lack of development.

Then, his patience snaps. "Fang Yuan!" he shouts, his voice echoing through the room. "You should accept your fate and stop being jealous of your siblings! I am utterly disappointed in you!"

The elder's glare intensifies, cutting into Fang Yuan like a blade. "Do you realize you’re the only reason Gu Xianer hasn’t advanced yet? You’re holding her back!" he exclaims, his tone sharp with disdain. "If Gu Xianer had chosen to stick with Fang Zheng instead of you, she would have already advanced her rank by now!"

The elder's words hang heavy in the air, suffocating the room with their weight. The entire class falls silent, their eyes darting between Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer. The whispers from his classmates over the past three months echo in Fang Yuan’s mind—words filled with disdain, judgment, and blame.














For months, he has endured an internal war no one can see. Demonic Fang Yuan, the relentless presence in his mind, has seized control of his body countless times, each time attempting to kill Gu Xianer. The fear of harming his sister, the helplessness of losing control, and the guilt of being unable to stop it have eaten away at him, leaving his mind fractured.

But it doesn’t stop there. His classmates gossip cruelly, calling him a curse and mocking his D-grade talent. His aunt and uncle, though obligated to care for him, often sigh in disappointment, comparing him to his talented siblings. Even the neighbors shake their heads whenever they see him, whispering behind his back, "What a shame. A disgrace to his family."

Everywhere he turns, it’s the same. The looks of pity, the whispers of disdain, and the sharp words cut deeper than any blade. He’s reminded of his inadequacy at every turn, his very existence weighed down by guilt and shame.

And now, the Academy elder’s scolding strikes like the final blow. "You’re holding her back! You should accept your fate!" The elder’s words echo like a hammer striking his soul, shattering what little strength he has left.

Fang Yuan’s chest tightens, his vision blurs, and the world feels as though it’s caving in. The pressure becomes unbearable—his fear, guilt, and helplessness swirling into a storm that finally breaks him.




Without warning, he collapses to the ground, his frail body hitting the floor with a lifeless thud. Gasps ripple through the classroom as his classmates recoil in shock. Gu Xianer rushes to his side, her face pale and her voice trembling. "Brother! Brother, wake up!"

The elder’s anger falters, replaced by unease, but his frustration lingers. "This is what happens when you let your emotions consume you," he mutters, shaking his head.

Gu Xianer spins toward him, tears streaming down her face. "Stop it! Stop blaming him!" she cries, her voice breaking. "He’s been through so much! You don’t even understand!"

The room is gripped by an eerie silence as Fang Yuan lies motionless on the cold floor, the toll of three months of torment finally taking its devastating price. Even in his unconscious state, the chains of judgment and despair remain tightly wound around him.

Fang Zheng steps forward, his expression carefully molded into one of anxious concern as he kneels beside his collapsed brother. "Brother! Are you okay? Someone get help!" he calls out, his voice trembling just enough to seem genuine.

But deep inside, his thoughts tell a different story. As he observes Fang Yuan’s pale and lifeless form, a cold smirk flickers in his mind. _"It looks like I’ve overestimated you. You can’t even handle this much pressure!"_

His inner voice twists into a silent, mocking laugh. _"Hehe... but seeing you in this state gives me a deep, indescribable satisfaction. After all, for you, I suffered so much worse in my previous life. Years of misery, humiliation, and despair—all because of you."_

His gaze sharpens momentarily as he watches Gu Xianer weeping by Fang Yuan’s side. _"Just stay like this, weak and broken. It’s exactly where you belong."_




But on the surface, Fang Zheng’s face remains a mask of concern, his hand resting gently on Fang Yuan’s shoulder as he continues to play the part of the worried brother.

Fang Yuan remains unconscious, his body as still as death, despite the passing hours. His sister, Gu Xianer, can barely hold back her tears, her sobs echoing through the silent room. Her hands tremble as she clutches his lifeless form, desperately trying to wake him. But no matter how hard she shakes him or calls his name, there’s no response.

The students, who had already been whispering cruelly about him, now openly murmur, their words dripping with disdain. "He should just die. What’s the point in him being alive, holding everyone back?"

A few students, unable to hide their bitter amusement, add, "At least it would end all the misery."

The Academy elder, ever the professional, tries various methods to revive Fang Yuan, but nothing works. He even goes as far as using spiritual methods to probe his mind, but to no avail. His frustration builds, yet he can’t find a solution. Finally, after exhausting all his options, Fang Yuan is taken to the medicine hall for treatment, but even the best healers can’t bring him back.

















A few days later, Fang Yuan is sent back to the family home, still in his unconscious state. Gu Xianer watches helplessly as they carry him in, her heart breaking with each step.

At the house, Fang Yuan’s aunt and uncle pretend to be deeply worried about his condition, sighing with feigned concern as they look at their nephew’s pale, unmoving form. "This is terrible… What if something happens to him?" they murmur, their voices tinged with false sympathy.

But inside, their thoughts are far different. "If he dies like **this**, we’ll inherit everything. All of it will be ours to devour. He should just die like this." The facade of concern is thin, but it’s enough to keep the situation in their favor. 

A week passes, and the house becomes eerily quiet. The initial stir of worry has faded, and no one shows any sign of concern for Fang Yuan’s condition, except for Gu Xianer. Her world has shrunk to the cold room where her brother lies motionless. She hasn’t slept, eaten, or rested properly for days. Her eyes are bloodshot, her face gaunt, the weight of exhaustion pressing down on her fragile frame.

Every moment, her gaze is fixed on Fang Yuan, her hands gently brushing through his hair, her voice soft as she whispers his name in desperation. "Brother, please wake up... please."

Tears blur her vision, and more often than not, she finds herself sobbing uncontrollably, unable to hold back the torrent of emotion. _"Why won’t he wake up?"_ She feels so helpless, so utterly alone in this. It’s as if the world has forgotten about them. The house is still, the air heavy with indifference from the aunt and uncle, who go about their days as if nothing is amiss.

But to Gu Xianer, the silence is suffocating. Every day, she cries a little more, clinging to the hope that her brother will open his eyes, that the nightmare will end. Her exhaustion is becoming unbearable, but she refuses to leave his side. She is the only one who cares, the only one who still holds onto the thread of hope that he might recover.

It’s as if time has frozen for her, and every passing second is another piece of her heart breaking.

In the darkness of Fang Yuan's mind, Administrator Fang Yuan’s voice rings out with a sharp, almost manic excitement. "Ha ha ha! The interesting things will happen after he wakes up. Just wait and see!"

But Demonic Fang Yuan, as always, remains unmoved. His presence is like a dark shadow in the recesses of Fang Yuan’s consciousness, distant and detached. He doesn’t show any emotion, his mind as cold and indifferent as ever.
