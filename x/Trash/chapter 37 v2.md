The afternoon sun casts a warm golden glow over the village as Fang Yuan prepares to head to the bustling market, accompanied by Gu Xianer and Gu Wang. The air is filled with anticipation, the promise of adventure hanging sweetly in the breeze. Just as they are about to set off, a familiar voice cuts through the calm like an arrow.

"Sister Xianer! Are you alright?!" Yao Le bursts into view, her eyes wide with concern, her steps hurried and frantic. Her voice rings out loud and clear, carrying both urgency and relief.

At the sound of her name, Gu Xianer’s face lights up like the morning sun breaking through clouds. "Sister Yao Le!" she exclaims, her voice brimming with excitement. She practically bounces on her feet, unable to contain her joy at seeing her friend. Grabbing Gu Wang's arm, she pulls her forward eagerly. "Look, Sister Yao Le! I’ve brought a new friend! This is Gu Wang—she’s amazing!"

Gu Wang, caught off guard by the sudden introduction, barely has time to react before she finds herself face-to-face with Yao Le, who stares at her with wide, curious eyes. The two exchange a brief, awkward silence before Yao Le beams.

“Wow! So you’re our new sister!” Yao Le says cheerfully, her previous concern instantly forgotten. “Nice to meet you!”

The three girls quickly fall into conversation, their chatter a mixture of excited voices and playful giggles. Gu Xianer bounces between them, her childlike energy infecting even Gu Wang, who—despite her best efforts—can’t help but smile at the warmth of it all.

But Fang Yuan, ever the orchestrator of chaos and charm, isn’t one to let the moment linger too long without adding his own flair. With a playful grin tugging at his lips, he steps forward, clapping his hands together to draw everyone’s attention.

"Well, well," he announces dramatically, his tone dripping with exaggerated importance, "since we’re all gathered here today, why not make this outing truly memorable? Let us embark on a grand journey—to the _market_ !" He sweeps his arm outward as if unveiling some magnificent treasure, his expression gleaming with mischief and delight.

His words hang in the air for a split second before Gu Xianer erupts into giggles, clapping her hands together in sheer excitement. "Yes, yes! Let’s go!" she cheers, bouncing on her toes. Even Yao Le can’t help but chuckle at Fang Yuan’s theatrical antics, shaking her head fondly.

And just like that, the four of them set off, stepping into the lively streets, the afternoon air buzzing with the promise of mischief, laughter, and whatever chaos Fang Yuan inevitably brings.

The road stretches before them, bathed in golden sunlight, the crisp afternoon air alive with the lively chatter of the girls. Laughter bubbles from their lips like a cascading stream, filling the path with warmth and cheer. Gu Xianer clings tightly to Gu Wang’s arm, her small frame bouncing slightly with each step. Yao Le skips along beside them, her curious eyes flickering between them, a spark of unspoken anticipation dancing within.

But then, without warning, Yao Le halts. Her expression shifts—serious, intense—her steps quickening as she moves toward Fang Yuan. The playful glint in her gaze fades, replaced by something heavier, something that trembles with worry.

“Yesterday, I was helping Grandma treat patients, so I couldn’t come,” she breathes, her voice urgent, barely above a whisper. “But last night… I heard you and Xianer went missing!” Her fists clench at her sides, her brows knit together. “Do you have _any_ idea how terrified I was? My heart nearly stopped! I didn’t even sleep—I just kept thinking about what could’ve happened to you two! As soon as I heard you were back, I ran here as fast as I could!” She takes another step forward, her voice nearly pleading. “Where were you? What _happened_?”

A heavy silence crashes over the group like a tidal wave.

Gu Wang’s face darkens instantly. It is as if storm clouds gather above her, shadowing her features with something unspoken, something suffocating. The memory claws at the edges of her mind—the blood, the horror, the sheer helplessness of it all. Her fingers curl slightly, her shoulders stiffening.

But beside her, Gu Xianer is… _different._ Her face holds no trace of the past terror. Instead, her eyes gleam with a soft, almost dreamlike haze. It is as if she has forgotten all the fear, all the danger—only the warmth of Fang Yuan’s madness remains in her heart. She remembers his reckless laughter, his unhinged confidence, the way he cradled her so gently after his battle. To her, the nightmare has already become a distant, unreal thing.

Then—

_Clap!_

Fang Yuan slaps a hand against his chest and straightens dramatically, as if he were some grand performer standing atop the grandest of stages. His expression morphs into one of sheer, exaggerated arrogance, his lips curling into a devilish smirk. Then, with a flourish of his arm, he _booms_—

“Ah, my dear Yao Le! You see, Gu Xianer and I did not simply _disappear!_” He throws his arms wide, his voice dripping with self-importance. “No, no, no! We embarked on a _legendary journey!_ A grand odyssey _beyond_ the borders of this humble village! We faced perils unknown, indulged in delights unimaginable, and—” He pauses, his eyes glinting mischievously. “—we even returned with a great _treasure!_”

With a dramatic wave of his arm, he gestures toward Gu Wang, grinning from ear to ear.

“Behold! The mighty warrior, Gu Wang! Our most _glorious_ acquisition!”

Gu Xianer immediately claps her hands, her entire being radiating excitement. “Yes, yes! And _even more,_ Brother fought the bad people so bravely!” She twirls, her sleeves fluttering like butterfly wings. “He was _so_ cool! He protected me with everything he had—so strong, so heroic!” Her eyes shine, her voice overflowing with pure admiration, the kind only a child could express.

Yao Le gasps, her mouth falling open in exaggerated disappointment. “What?! A grand adventure _and_ a battle?! I missed all of that?!” She stomps her foot, crossing her arms in mock frustration. “Next time, you _must_ call me before you go! I _refuse_ to be left behind again!”

Fang Yuan strokes his chin, as if pondering a deep, philosophical truth. Then, with a slow, exaggerated nod, he declares, “Of course, dear Yao Le. Your presence would undoubtedly elevate our future escapades to _unprecedented_ heights of grandeur.” He bows deeply, his voice silky smooth, his expression unreadable. “Next time, we shall embark _together._”

Something in his tone—playful yet strangely sincere—eases the weight in Gu Wang’s chest. She lets out a slow breath, feeling the tightness in her shoulders melt away, just a little.

Her eyes flicker toward Gu Xianer. The girl looks… happy. Completely and utterly free of worry. No fear, no hesitation, no lingering shadows of that dreadful night. Just pure, innocent joy. _She’s truly at peace._

And just like that, Gu Wang feels the last remnants of dread slip away. A quiet relief settles over her, so deep that it almost shakes her. She exhales, long and slow, as if releasing a burden she hadn’t even realized she was carrying.

Her gaze drifts toward Fang Yuan.

For a moment, she simply _watches_ him. The way he moves, the way his expression shifts so effortlessly between madness and amusement. He is chaotic. Unpredictable. Infuriating beyond reason. _Utterly_ insane.

And yet—

She finds herself hesitating, her heart caught in something she cannot quite name.

Her lips part slightly, her voice barely above a whisper as the words slip out, unbidden.

“…He’s really, really…”

She doesn’t finish. She _can’t_ finish. Because no word, no thought, no explanation could ever fully capture what Fang Yuan _is._

But as she watches him—this whirlwind of contradictions, this devil wrapped in human skin—one thing becomes clear.

He is more than just the sum of his madness.

He is something _else entirely._
