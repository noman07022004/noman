After a few moments, the healer enters the room, his robes swaying as he approaches Fang Yuan with a practiced calmness. The tension in the room seems to shift as everyone watches him with expectant eyes.

The healer kneels beside Fang Yuan, gently checking his pulse and examining him closely. He lets out a thoughtful hum before turning to face the others. His expression is a mix of astonishment and professional restraint.

“It’s truly a miracle that he’s woken up after being unconscious for a whole month,” the healer remarks, shaking his head slightly. “Frankly, I had thought he wouldn’t wake up at all. His condition was far worse than I expected.”

Hearing this, Gu Xianer, who is still cradling Fang Yuan’s head in her lap, tightens her grip protectively. Tears glisten in her eyes as she whispers, “Brother is strong. He’ll get through this.”

The healer nods sympathetically before holding out a small vial filled with a shimmering liquid. “Continue feeding him this liquid, just as you’ve been doing. It’s helping stabilize his body. However…” He pauses, his tone growing more serious, “…based on the description of his actions and the state he’s in now, it seems he’s experiencing severe mental distress. Something is deeply troubling his mind.”

Gu Xianer’s eyes widen with worry, and she looks down at Fang Yuan’s pale face. “What do you mean by mental distress? Can you… can you help him?” she asks, her voice trembling.

The healer sighs, shaking his head. “I can treat physical injuries and illnesses, but matters of the mind are much more complex. Whatever is tormenting him, it must be addressed at its root. Otherwise, his condition could worsen.”

Uncle and Aunt exchange uneasy glances. Aunt frowns and crosses her arms, muttering under her breath, “So now he’s not only weak but mentally unstable too. What a burden…”

Fang Zheng, standing to the side, smirks faintly, hiding his true thoughts behind a facade of mild concern. _Mental issues, huh? This will only make him easier to manipulate,_ he muses.

The healer, oblivious to their thoughts, continues, “Make sure he rests well and avoid anything that could agitate him further. Let him recover slowly. And if he shows any more strange behaviors, call me immediately.”

Gu Xianer nods firmly, her resolve unwavering. “I’ll take care of him. I won’t let anything happen to him.”

The healer rises to his feet, looking at her with a faint smile. “He’s fortunate to have someone as devoted as you. Keep a close eye on him.”

With that, the healer takes his leave, leaving the room heavy with unspoken emotions. Gu Xianer continues to hold Fang Yuan close, her heart filled with both hope and dread for what lies ahead. Meanwhile, Uncle, Aunt, and Fang Zheng watch silently, their hidden agendas swirling beneath their surface expressions.

In the soft light of the morning, the sound of footsteps approaches the room. Yao Le, a petite girl with a bright smile, enters, accompanied by a member of the Medicine Hall. Though younger than Gu Xianer, her confidence and warmth make her seem wise beyond her years.

"Gu Xianer!" Yao Le calls out cheerfully, her voice cutting through the quiet. "I heard your brother has awakened. Haven't I told you he’d come back?" Her smile is radiant, filled with genuine happiness for her friend.

Gu Xianer, who has barely slept, looks up from Fang Yuan's bedside, her eyes red and puffy from tears. Seeing Yao Le, the emotions she’s been holding in overflow. Without a word, she starts crying again, her tears falling freely.

Yao Le rushes over, sitting beside her and gently placing a hand on her shoulder. "Gu Xianer, what’s wrong? Aren’t you happy that your brother woke up?"

Through her sobs, Gu Xianer shakes her head and finally speaks, her voice trembling, "Yao Le… I’m so happy he’s awake… but… I’m scared. He… he’s been acting so strange, like he’s carrying something I can’t see. I don’t know how to help him, and I feel so helpless… What if he breaks again?"

Yao Le listens attentively, her expression softening. She takes Gu Xianer’s hands in hers, squeezing them reassuringly. "Gu Xianer, your brother came back because he’s strong. And he’s lucky to have you. You’re doing everything you can for him. Just keep being by his side. Sometimes, that’s all someone needs."

Gu Xianer wipes her tears, sniffling. "But what if it’s not enough? What if I can’t protect him? He’s my brother, and I don’t want to lose him again."

Yao Le smiles gently. "You won’t lose him. You’ve already done so much. You stayed by his side when no one else did. You gave him your strength, Gu Xianer. And I’ll be here too. You don’t have to do this alone."

Hearing those words, Gu Xianer feels a small sense of relief. She takes a deep breath, nodding slightly, though tears still glisten in her eyes. "Thank you, Yao Le… I don’t know what I’d do without you. You’ve been helping me so much since you saw me in the Medicine Hall."

Yao Le smiles warmly and squeezes Gu Xianer’s hands again. "Of course I helped. You looked so heartbroken that day. I remember it clearly… You were sitting in the corner, crying so much you couldn’t even speak. When I saw you like that, I couldn’t just stand by and do nothing. I felt really sad for you, Gu Xianer."

Gu Xianer’s voice trembles as she responds, "I remember that day too. I thought I was all alone. Fang Yuan had just… collapsed, and no one seemed to care. But then you came to me and told me everything would be okay."

Yao Le nods, her expression soft and sincere. "I meant every word. When I saw how much you loved your brother, how you never left his side no matter how hard it got, I admired you. You’re stronger than you think, Gu Xianer."

Gu Xianer looks down at her lap, her fingers tightening slightly around Yao Le’s. "I didn’t feel strong. I felt so weak and helpless. But… you gave me strength, Yao Le. Every time you came to see me, every time you told me to keep believing in him, it gave me hope."

Yao Le chuckles lightly, brushing a stray strand of hair behind her ear. "And look where that hope got you—your brother’s awake now, just like I said he would be. I knew he’d come back because he’s lucky to have a sister like you. He’s probably stronger than anyone realizes."

Gu Xianer smiles faintly, wiping away the last of her tears. "I’ll always believe in him, no matter what. Thank you for everything, Yao Le. I don’t think I could have made it through this without you."

Yao Le stands up, her bright demeanor returning. "That’s what friends are for, Gu Xianer. And I’ll keep helping you, no matter what. You’re not alone in this, okay?"

Yao Le prepares to leave after chatting for a while, but as she stands, she notices movement from Fang Yuan. Her eyes widen with excitement, and she calls out softly, "Gu Xianer, look! He’s waking up!"


Gu Xianer quickly turns her attention to her brother. Fang Yuan opens his eyes slowly, blinking as his vision adjusts. The first thing he sees is Gu Xianer, her face streaked with tears but lit up by a joyful smile. Despite her tears, she looks relieved, and seeing her, Fang Yuan smiles faintly in return, as if everything from the previous night has been wiped away.

But then his gaze shifts. He notices Yao Le sitting beside Gu Xianer, her bright smile and cheerful presence catching him off guard. A strange, unshakable feeling stirs in him. His brow furrows slightly as he stares at her, a sense of familiarity creeping over him.

"Yao Le…" he mutters under his breath, almost inaudibly.

She tilts her head, confused but still smiling. "Yes? That’s me. It’s nice to finally meet you properly, Brother Fang Yuan."

Fang Yuan rubs his eyes as if trying to clear a fog in his mind. His gaze sharpens on her, his confusion deepening. Something about her face, her laughter, tugs at the edges of his memory. His head starts throbbing.

Without realizing it, he extends his hand toward her. Yao Le, caught off guard, blinks in surprise as Fang Yuan’s trembling hand brushes Yao Le’s cheek, her face turns crimson, and she instinctively jumps back, startled. “Wh-what are you doing, Fang Yuan?” she stammers, holding her hand to her cheek.

Fang Yuan freezes, his trembling hand dropping to his side. His wide, fearful eyes remain locked on Yao Le, but in that moment, she fades from view as a vivid, bloody memory surges into his mind.





In the memory, Yao Le kneels on the ground, her clothes torn and dirtied, her face streaked with tears. Her eyes are wide with terror as she pleads, her voice shaking, “Please… Fang Yuan, why are you doing this? I’ve always been kind to you. Please, don’t hurt me!”

But his expression in the memory is cold, devoid of mercy. He doesn’t speak. Instead, his hand clenches her hair, forcing her to her feet. Yao Le’s cries grow louder, desperation and disbelief filling her voice. “We’re friends! How can you—”

Her words are cut off as Fang Yuan, unflinching and ruthless, shoves her toward a massive bear chained nearby. The beast roars, its bloodstained claws swiping through the air. Yao Le stumbles, falling to the ground in front of it. She turns to him one last time, sobbing, “Why?!”

The memory ends with the horrifying sight of the bear lunging at her, its jaws closing in as her screams echo in his ears.

Back in the present, Fang Yuan gasps sharply, his chest heaving. His entire body trembles as he clutches his head, tears streaming down his face. The vision was so vivid, so real, that he can feel the weight of his past self’s cold indifference.

“No…” he whispers, his voice cracking.  His voice grows louder, his cries more anguished. 

Fang Yuan collapses to his knees, trembling as his tears fall uncontrollably. The horrifying memory of his past self’s cruelty burns in his mind, and he whispers brokenly, “This isn’t true… This can’t be true…How could I do something like this to you, Yao Le? How could I be that cruel?”

Yao Le, still confused but deeply concerned, kneels in front of him. Her heart aches to see him in such pain. She glances at Gu Xianer, who is sobbing quietly while holding Fang Yuan’s arm, and then back at Fang Yuan, who looks utterly shattered.

She remembers what the elder had told her earlier: _"Fang Yuan’s mental state is fragile. Even small things might seem overwhelming to him."_ Yao Le blushes faintly, recalling the moment he had touched her cheek earlier, and she hesitates for a second before leaning in closer.

“Fang Yuan,” Yao Le says softly, her voice trembling but warm. “You… you haven’t done anything cruel. I don’t know why you’re so sad, but…” She pauses, her cheeks turning pink, then speaks with more determination, her sincerity shining through. “If you think touching my cheek was cruel… it’s not. Look.”

She gently tilts her head to the side, brushing her hair back, and leans forward slightly, her face inches from his. “If it makes you feel better, you can touch my cheek again. See? It’s not cruel. It’s okay.”

Her voice softens even further, and she tries to hold back her own tears. “You’re not a bad person, Fang Yuan. I know you’re not. I don’t understand why you’re hurting so much, but… if this helps, then it’s okay. I don’t mind.”

Fang Yuan’s tear-streaked face lifts, his wide, glassy eyes locking onto hers. For a moment, he’s completely still, her words echoing in his mind. But the memory of his past self resurfaces again—the cold indifference, the brutality, the way he had ignored her pleas. His heart feels like it’s being torn apart.

“No,” he croaks, his voice breaking. “You don’t understand… It’s not about that…” He shakes his head violently, as if trying to dislodge the memory. “You don’t deserve… You don’t deserve someone like me near you…”

Gu Xianer grips his arm tighter, her tears falling as she whispers, “Brother, stop saying that! You’re not bad. You’re my brother!”

But Fang Yuan’s torment doesn’t subside. He clutches his head, rocking slightly as he murmurs, “I hurt you… I hurt you so much… How could I? How could I?”

Yao Le blinks back tears of her own, confused but unwilling to leave him in such agony. “Fang Yuan,” she whispers, leaning closer again, “whatever it is, it’s not your fault. You’re just… you’re not well right now. Please, believe me. You’re not cruel.”

Her gentle words and the sight of her sincere, blushing face stir something deep inside Fang Yuan—a strange mixture of hope and despair. He looks at her again, his voice trembling. “Yao Le… You’re too kind… I don’t deserve it…”

She gives him a soft, wobbly smile, her own tears falling now. “I’m not being kind. I’m just telling the truth.” She hesitates for a moment before adding, “If you need proof, I’ll be here. I’ll always be here. No matter what.”

Gu Xianer chokes on a sob, wrapping her arms around Fang Yuan tightly. “See, brother? You’re not alone. We’re both here for you. Please stop blaming yourself.”

Fang Yuan’s trembling slows slightly as he feels the warmth of Gu Xianer’s embrace and the kindness in Yao Le’s voice. But the guilt doesn’t fully fade—it clings to him like a shadow, whispering in the back of his mind. Yet, in this moment, their presence gives him the smallest glimmer of light in his overwhelming darkness.
