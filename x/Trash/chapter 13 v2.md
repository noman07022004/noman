On a rare day off, Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer stroll through the bustling market of the Gu Yue Clan. The market is alive with energy, with vendors shouting their wares, children weaving through the crowd, and the tantalizing aroma of grilled meat and fresh pastries filling the air.

As they approach a fruit vendor’s stall, Fang Yuan slows down and gestures at the neatly stacked piles of fruit. “Look carefully, Xianer. This vendor is smart. See how he puts the best-looking fruits on top? The ones underneath might not be as good. Always inspect closely before you buy.”

Gu Xianer nods enthusiastically, her eyes scanning the stall. She picks up an apple and frowns dramatically. “Brother, look! There’s a tiny spot on this one. Maybe we can get it for half price!”

The vendor, a middle-aged man with a thick mustache, chuckles. “Little lady, that spot is nothing. This apple is as fresh as they come.”

Gu Xianer puts on her most innocent face, clutching the apple to her chest. “But what if I get sick from eating it? My poor brother would be heartbroken!” She glances at Fang Yuan, her eyes wide and pleading. “Brother, wouldn’t you be sad if I got sick?”

Fang Yuan sighs, covering his face with his hand to hide his amusement. “Xianer…”

The vendor laughs heartily, shaking his head. “Alright, alright. You can have it for a little less, but only because you’re so dramatic!”

Gu Xianer beams and hands over the coins, then whispers to Fang Yuan as they walk away, “See? My way works!”

Fang Yuan smirks. “That wasn’t negotiating. That was emotional blackmail.”

“It’s still a skill!” she retorts, sticking out her tongue.

At another stall selling herbs, Fang Yuan decides to test her further. “Alright, Xianer. Let’s see how you handle this one. Try to buy some herbs, but this time, use logic—not dramatics.”

She nods confidently and marches up to the stall. The vendor, an elderly woman with sharp eyes, greets her with a polite smile. “What can I get for you, little miss?”

Gu Xianer picks up a bundle of dried herbs and sniffs them. “Hmm… these don’t smell very strong. Are you sure they’re fresh?”

The vendor raises an eyebrow. “These are dried herbs, little one. They’re not supposed to smell strong.”

Gu Xianer blinks, momentarily stumped. Then, she points at another bundle. “What about these? They look smaller than the others. Shouldn’t they be cheaper?”

The vendor chuckles. “These are a rarer variety. They’re supposed to be smaller.”

Gu Xianer frowns, clearly out of her depth. She glances back at Fang Yuan, who is watching with his arms crossed, smirking. Determined not to lose face, she leans in toward the vendor and whispers, “How about I buy these, and in return, I tell all my friends to come to your stall? That’s good for your business, right?”

The vendor laughs so hard she nearly drops her basket. “Alright, little negotiator. You can have a small discount for the effort.”

Gu Xianer returns to Fang Yuan with her prize, looking triumphant. “See? I did it again!”

Fang Yuan shakes his head, though he can’t hide his smile. “Your logic is as wobbly as a three-legged stool. But I’ll admit, your determination is impressive.”

Their next stop is a stall selling handmade trinkets. Gu Xianer’s eyes light up as she spots a small, intricately carved wooden figurine of a rabbit. “Brother, look at this! It’s so cute!”

Fang Yuan watches as she begins her “negotiation.” She picks up the figurine and cradles it like it’s a precious gem. “This rabbit is adorable, but it’s missing something…”

The vendor looks confused. “Missing something? What do you mean?”

Gu Xianer points at the figurine’s face. “Its eyes aren’t shiny enough. How can it be a proper rabbit without shiny eyes? Don’t you think that makes it worth less?”

The vendor scratches his head, unsure how to respond. “Uh… I suppose…”

Sensing his hesitation, Gu Xianer presses on. “If you give it to me for half price, I’ll take good care of it and give it a good home. It’ll be happy with me, I promise.”

The vendor laughs, shaking his head. “Alright, alright. Half price it is. You’re a strange one, little miss.”

As they leave the stall, Fang Yuan looks at her in disbelief. “Did you really just negotiate on behalf of a wooden rabbit?”

Gu Xianer grins. “And it worked, didn’t it?”

“You’re hopeless,” Fang Yuan mutters, though his tone is fond.

Finally, they come to a quieter corner of the market, where the road stretches out toward the mountains. The air is cooler here, and the distant sound of a flowing stream adds to the serene atmosphere. Gu Xianer suddenly tugs on Fang Yuan’s sleeve, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

“Brother! Do you remember the promise you made to me?”

Fang Yuan looks at her, puzzled. “Promise? What promise?”

Her expression shifts to an exaggerated pout. “You promised me, back when we were kids, that when we became Gu Masters, you’d take me out of the village to explore the mountains!”

Fang Yuan frowns, trying to recall. “I… don’t remember making such a promise.”

Gu Xianer’s cheeks puff up indignantly. “You did! How could you forget something so important?”

Seeing her growing irritation, Fang Yuan sighs in surrender. “Alright, alright. Don’t get angry, my little princess. But the mountains are dangerous—”

She cuts him off, pointing at the road. “Look! Even old people, kids, and weak villagers are walking along that road. They’re not Gu Masters, and they’re fine. Why can’t we go?”

Fang Yuan tries to argue, but her logic—or lack thereof—leaves him speechless. Finally, he sighs in defeat. “Fine, you win. But stay close to me and hold my hand tightly. Don’t let go for any reason.”

Gu Xianer’s annoyance vanishes instantly, replaced by a bright grin. “Thank you, brother! Let’s go!”

As Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer step beyond the gates of the Gu Yue Clan, Gu Xianer clasps his hand tightly, her eyes wide with wonder. The road ahead is lined with lush greenery, wildflowers blooming in bursts of color, and the soft sound of a nearby stream threading through the air.

“Brother! Look!” she exclaims, pointing at the mountains in the distance. “The trees are so tall! Do you think they’re as tall as the heavens? Maybe even taller!”

Fang Yuan chuckles, shaking his head. “Xianer, those trees aren’t even half as tall as the mountains behind them.”

She tilts her head, as though this is the most shocking revelation she’s ever heard. “But they look so big! If we climb to the top, do you think we’ll be able to touch the clouds?”

“Sure,” Fang Yuan replies dryly, humoring her. “If you bring a really tall ladder.”

Gu Xianer gasps, clapping her hands. “Brother, we should buy a ladder from the next village market! Then we can bring it back here and touch the clouds together!”

Fang Yuan sighs, though there’s a small smile tugging at his lips. “You’re impossible.”

As they continue walking, Gu Xianer’s curiosity knows no bounds. She stops to inspect a bush full of berries, poking at them with her finger. “Brother, are these safe to eat? They look so shiny! Maybe they’re a gift from the heavens!”

Fang Yuan crouches down and examines the berries. “No, they’re poisonous. Don’t eat them unless you want to spend the rest of the day writhing on the ground.”

Gu Xianer pulls her hand back quickly, her cheeks puffing out in embarrassment. “Hmph. I knew that. I was just testing you to see if _you_ knew!”

“Oh, of course,” Fang Yuan replies, rolling his eyes.

Further along the road, they come across a small clearing where wildflowers blanket the ground in a riot of colors. Gu Xianer tugs on his sleeve, her eyes sparkling. “Brother, let’s pick some flowers! I’ll make a crown for you!”

Fang Yuan raises an eyebrow. “A crown? For me?”

“Yes! You’ll look like the King of Flowers!” she declares with absolute certainty.

“I’m not sure that’s a title I want,” he mutters, but Gu Xianer is already darting into the flowers, picking them with an excited grin.

---

Eventually, they reach a small village market nestled in the valley. Gu Xianer’s excitement reaches a fever pitch as she takes in the sights and sounds. There are stalls selling everything from fresh produce to handmade trinkets, and the air is filled with the aroma of sizzling snacks.

“Brother! Look at all these stalls! Can we buy something? Please?” she pleads, tugging on his arm.

“Alright, but let’s keep it reasonable,” Fang Yuan warns.

They stop at a stall selling grilled skewers, the smell making Gu Xianer’s stomach growl audibly. She points at a skewer loaded with juicy, roasted meat. “Brother, I want that one!”

The vendor smiles. “One skewer is two primeval stones.”

Gu Xianer gasps, her expression scandalized. “Two stones? That’s robbery! This skewer isn’t even that big!” She leans closer to the vendor, narrowing her eyes. “How about one stone? I mean, look at me—I’m so small, I can’t even eat that much.”

The vendor laughs. “Little miss, that’s not how it works.”

“Then how about this,” Gu Xianer counters, tapping her chin thoughtfully. “I’ll give you one stone now, and when I grow bigger, I’ll come back and buy more. That’s a good deal for you, isn’t it?”

The vendor tries to hold back his laughter but fails. “You’re quite the negotiator. Fine, one and a half stones, just for you.”

Gu Xianer pouts but reluctantly hands over the payment. As she bites into the skewer, her face lights up with delight. “Brother, you have to try this! It’s so good!”

Fang Yuan takes a small bite and nods. “It’s not bad.”

They wander further into the market, stopping at a stall selling colorful trinkets. Gu Xianer picks up a small, carved wooden bird. “Brother, look at this! It’s so cute!”

The vendor smiles. “That one’s three stones.”

Gu Xianer puts the bird back with exaggerated disappointment. “Three stones for something that doesn’t even chirp? That’s way too much.”

The vendor blinks, confused. “It’s just a carving. It’s not supposed to chirp.”

“But wouldn’t it be better if it did?” she argues, crossing her arms. “You should give me a discount since it’s missing a key feature.”

Fang Yuan pinches the bridge of his nose, trying not to laugh. “Xianer, let’s move on before you confuse the poor man even more.”

As the sun begins to set, Fang Yuan notices the light dimming around them. “Xianer, it’s getting late. We should head back before it gets dark.”

“But, brother! There’s still so much to see!” she protests, her lower lip jutting out in a pout.

“We can come back another time,” he says firmly, taking her hand.

She sighs but doesn’t resist, clutching his hand as they make their way back toward the clan. Along the way, she chatters endlessly about everything they saw, her voice filled with excitement.

“Brother, today was so much fun! Next time, let’s bring a ladder and touch the clouds, okay?”

Fang Yuan chuckles, shaking his head. “Sure, Xianer. Whatever you say.”

As they walk under the fading light of the evening sky, Fang Yuan feels a rare sense of peace. Despite her endless energy and illogical antics, Gu Xianer’s joy is infectious. For a moment, he allows himself to enjoy the simplicity of her happiness, knowing that these moments are fleeting but precious.
