The kidnappers trudged through the jagged terrain, their boots crunching against the rocky path as the wind howled like a mournful dirge. Gu Xianer’s limp body hung over one of their shoulders, her once-vibrant form now a broken doll, her silken hair trailing like a banner of defeat. Her breaths were shallow, barely audible, as if her very soul was clinging to the edge of existence. The cave loomed ahead, its gaping maw a harbinger of the horrors to come.

Inside the damp, shadowy cavern, the air was thick with the stench of sweat and malice. One of the kidnappers, a brutish man with greedy eyes, reached for Gu Xianer’s robes, his fingers trembling with anticipation. But before he could lay a hand on her, the leader’s voice cracked through the air like a whip. “How dare you touch her before me? Do you want to die?” The words were laced with venom, and the man recoiled as if struck, his face pale with fear. He stammered an apology, his voice trembling, but the leader’s glare silenced him.

The leader, a man whose very presence exuded cruelty, stepped forward. His rank 2 upper stage cultivation aura pulsed with a dark, oppressive energy, suffocating the room. He roughly tore away Gu Xianer’s upper dress, his hands trembling not with desire but with a perverse hunger for domination. The fabric ripped like a scream, revealing her delicate frame, now marred by bruises and dirt. His lips curled into a grotesque smile as he reveled in her vulnerability.

But then, a roar echoed from outside the cave—a primal, guttural sound that sent shivers down their spines. The leader’s face twisted in fury, his moment of pleasure shattered. “Go and kill that wretched beast!” he barked at two of his men, his voice dripping with rage. The two kidnappers hesitated, their eyes flickering with fear, but a single glance from their leader sent them scrambling out into the night.

As the echoes of their footsteps faded, Gu Xianer stirred. Her eyelids fluttered open, and for a moment, there was a flicker of hope in her eyes—a desperate, fleeting hope that this was all a nightmare. But reality crashed down on her like a tidal wave as she felt the cold, rough hands of the leader groping at her lower dress. Panic surged through her veins, and she thrashed violently, her voice tearing through the cave like a wounded animal’s cry. “No! Stop! Help me, someone, please!”

The other two kidnappers, their faces twisted with sadistic glee, seized her arms and legs, pinning her down with brutal force. Her struggles were futile, her strength no match for their combined might. The leader’s hands moved with methodical cruelty, stripping away her dignity piece by piece. Her undergarments were torn away, leaving her exposed and defenseless. His fingers traced her skin, leaving trails of revulsion in their wake, and Gu Xianer’s screams turned to sobs, her body trembling with a mixture of fear and despair.

“Where is my brother?” she choked out between sobs, her voice breaking. “Is he okay? Please, tell me he’s alive!”

The leader paused, his lips curling into a sinister grin. “He’s dead,” he said, his voice dripping with malice. “His body is probably being devoured by wild beasts as we speak. Ha ha ha!” The other kidnappers joined in his laughter, their voices echoing like a chorus of demons. “Your brother loved you so much,” one of them sneered, tightening his grip on her arm. “He fought like a madman to save you. Pathetic.”

Gu Xianer’s heart shattered. The weight of her regret was unbearable, crushing her spirit like a stone. She had ignored her brother’s warnings, dismissed his concerns, and now he was gone—torn away from her by her own foolishness. Tears streamed down her face, each one a testament to her anguish. Her body went limp, her will to fight extinguished. She closed her eyes, her mind retreating into a dark abyss of sorrow.

But then, a spark of defiance ignited within her. With a sudden burst of strength, she hurled her head toward the ground, desperate to end her torment. The sickening crack of her skull meeting stone echoed through the cave, and blood poured from the wound, staining the ground crimson. The leader’s eyes widened in fury, and he grabbed her head, forcing her to look at him. “Why are you in such a hurry?” he hissed, his breath hot and foul against her face. “Don’t worry, we’ll send you to your brother soon enough—after we’ve had our fun.”

Gu Xianer’s body convulsed with sobs as the leader resumed his assault. She tried to resist, to smash her head against the ground again, but the other kidnappers held her fast, their grips unyielding. Her strength waned, and she felt herself slipping away, her mind retreating into a haze of pain and regret. “Maybe this is my punishment,” she thought, her tears flowing like rivers. “For not listening to him. For not being there when he needed me. I hope… I hope he’s alive. I hope he’s happy.”

As the leader’s laughter filled the cave, a sound so vile it seemed to poison the very air, Gu Xianer closed her eyes. She had no more tears to shed, no more screams to give. Her body was broken, her spirit shattered. And in that moment, she wished for nothing more than the sweet release of death.

The cave is the sound of the ragged breaths of the kidnappers and the faint, trembling sobs of Gu Xianer. The leader’s grotesque laughter still hung in the air, a vile echo of the unspeakable act he was about to commit. His hands, calloused and cruel, gripped her with a possessiveness that made her skin crawl. Gu Xianer’s eyes were shut tight, her mind retreating into a void of despair, her body numb to everything but the cold, unyielding stone beneath her.

And then, it happened.

A sharp, jagged rock tore through the air with a whistle so faint it was almost imperceptible. It struck the leader’s neck with a sickening _thunk_, piercing through flesh and sinew with brutal precision. His laughter died in his throat, replaced by a wet, gurgling choke. His eyes bulged, wide with shock and pain, as blood erupted from the wound in a crimson spray. He collapsed onto Gu Xianer, his weight pressing her into the cold stone, his blood cascading over her face in a hot, sticky torrent. She gasped, her eyes flying open, only to be met with the sight of his face—twisted in agony, his mouth working soundlessly as he clutched at his neck. Blood bubbled between his fingers, each pulse of his failing heart sending another spurt of lifeblood onto her skin.

Before the others could react, more rocks followed, each one a deadly projectile that found its mark with unerring accuracy. One by one, the kidnappers fell, their throats torn open, their hands clawing desperately at the wounds as if they could somehow stem the tide of their own mortality. Blood pooled beneath them, spreading across the cave floor in dark, glistening rivulets. One man tried to summon a defensive Gu worm, its shimmering barrier flickering to life for the briefest of moments before another rock shattered it like glass. Another fumbled for a healing Gu worm, his hands trembling so violently he could barely hold it, but the pain was too much—his body convulsed, and the worm fell from his grasp, useless.

Their screams were guttural, choked, and wet, a cacophony of agony that filled the cave. “Kill me!” one of them rasped, his voice barely audible over the sound of his own blood gurgling in his throat. “Please… end it!” But there was no mercy to be found. They writhed on the ground, their movements growing weaker as their lifeblood drained away, their eyes wide with terror and regret.

Gu Xianer lay frozen, her body trembling beneath the weight of the dying leader. Her mind struggled to process what was happening. The warmth of his blood on her face, the metallic tang of it in her mouth, the sight of the other kidnappers twitching and gasping like fish out of water—it was too much. Her breath came in shallow, panicked gasps, her heart pounding so loudly it drowned out the dying cries around her.

And then, from the shadows, a figure emerged.

He moved slowly, each step deliberate, as if every movement cost him unimaginable pain. His form was barely recognizable as human—his body was a tapestry of wounds, each one a testament to the hell he had endured. His clothes hung in tatters, soaked through with blood that dripped steadily onto the ground. One arm dangled uselessly at his side, the bones clearly shattered, the flesh torn and mangled. His face was a nightmare—a gaping wound across his cheek revealed the white of his teeth, and one eye was a ruin, the orb split open, its internal structures grotesquely visible. The other eye, however, was worse—it was dark, endless, a void that seemed to swallow the light itself. It was the eye of a predator, of something that had stared into the abyss and emerged changed.

Gu Xianer’s breath caught in her throat. She couldn’t look away, couldn’t even blink. Her mind screamed at her to run, to hide, to do anything but stay there, but her body refused to obey. She was paralyzed, her terror so complete it felt like a physical weight pressing down on her chest.

And then, the figure’s gaze shifted to her. The dark, abyssal eye seemed to pierce through her very soul, and for a moment, she thought she was looking at death itself. But then, something changed. The darkness in his eye receded, replaced by a warmth, a familiarity that made her heart ache. The terrifying figure before her was Fang Yuan.

“Gu… Xianer…” His voice was a hoarse whisper, barely audible, but it was enough. The sound of her name on his lips shattered the spell of fear that had gripped her. She saw him now—not as a monster, but as the brother who had fought through hell to save her. His broken body, his wounds, his pain—it was all for her.

He took a step toward her, his one good hand reaching out, but his strength failed him. His legs buckled, and he collapsed to the ground with a sickening thud. The sound snapped Gu Xianer out of her daze. She scrambled to her feet, her body trembling, her hands slick with blood, and rushed to his side.

“Fang Yuan!” she cried, her voice breaking. She dropped to her knees beside him, her hands hovering over his broken form, unsure of where to even begin. Her healing Gu worms sprang to life, their soft glow illuminating his ravaged body. She worked frantically, her tears falling onto his bloodied skin as she whispered desperate prayers to any god that might be listening.

“Please… please don’t die,” she begged, her voice barely a whisper. “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…”

Fang Yuan’s remaining eye fluttered open, and for a moment, he looked at her with such tenderness it made her heart ache. And then, his eye closed, and his body went still.

In Fang Yuan's mind,
Administrator Fang Yuan says to Demonic Fang Yuan, "Her [[Supreme Healing Divine Physique]] is really powerful. If it wasn't for her healing, there would be no Fang Yuan anymore. Ha ha ha. I can understand why it is so much more practical to devour her physique. If we have devoured her physique, it would have automatically healed all of our injuries. Not only that, it can even bring back people from death. This is really a heaven defying power. Ha ha ha. She doesn't know how to use her physique. She doesn't need any healing Gu Worm to heal not only her but also others. By using healing Gu Worm, she can't even using a fraction of her power."

Demonic Fang Yuan responds without expression as if he is indifferent, "This is quite new. I have also thought that why we need to use Gu Worm at first place and founds out that our body is designed in a way that we can't hold any power of heaven and earth. I have felt this in the outer space where I can't use even a single Gu worm and they even got destroyed when used."

Administrator Fang Yuan says, "I can't give you the answer as it is a forbidden knowledge. but you have already noticed it that this ambush was manipulated by heaven's will as it was totally confused about Fang Yuan's situation. After observation, the heaven's will have come to the conclusion that the Naive Fang Yuan has rejected his future self where he is Demonic Fang Yuan which was totally out of Heaven's Will's calculation. Then heaven's will sees that Fang Zheng is doing well and can be used for it's plan and so it has started helping Fang Zheng. At last, heaven's will decided to take harder step to test Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer who are creating continuous obstacles in its plan. According to heaven's will's, Gu Xianer is an unwanted child with forbidden power, so it is trying to eliminate a great threat for it's existence."

After giving a pause, Administrator Fang Yuan gives a laughter and declares, "Soon, you don't have to do anything. ha ha ha. A new personality is developing which will bridge the gap between You, Demonic Fang Yuan and your naive self, Naive Fang Yuan. Ha ha ha. From Now on, I will be the one who will create plan. ha ha ha. This is not any normal merging process. It would be very interesting one which even you can't predict."

Demonic Fang Yuan doesn't responds as if he doesn't care and is indifferent to everything even about his own death.
