The next day, in the early morning, Gu Xianer comes very close to Fang Yang’s face and starts tapping Fang Yuan’s face with her cute finger and then moves her mouth very close to Fang Yuan’s ear and says gently, "Brother, wake up. The breakfast is ready. Everyone will start eating soon, and we will be late for our academy class.”

After some failed attempt to wake up Fang Yuan, Gu Xianer becomes irritated as well as angry. 

Then gives a devilish but cute smile and then mumbles, “Don’t blame me for what I am going to do with you. He he he!” Then, with one of her small and soft hands, she grabs Fang Yuan’s nose and with the other hand so that he can't take breath. With her other hand, she grabs Fang Yuan’s lips closed so that he can’t take breath using his mouth too. Quickly moves her mouth very close to Fang Yuan’s ear and shouts, “Big brother, wake up.” 

  

Fang Yuan, startled awake by the sudden lack of air and the loud sound in his ear, blinks groggily as his eyes adjust to the sight of Gu Xianer’s mischievous smile hovering over him. He sights deeply, clearly torn between frustration and fondness. Rubbing his eyes, Fang Yuan grumbles, “Xianer, do you wake me up or try to end my life?” His tone, though hard, carries a trace of affection. Hearing this, Gu Xianer puffs her cheeks in anger. Seeing her anger, Fang Yuan laughs quietly and taps her forehead gently and says, “Ok, ok, you win. I will go and wash myself, and then I will eat with you.”

Gu Xianer doesn’t respond and puffs her cheeks even more in anger. In a panic, Fang Yuan shouts, “Ok, ok, I will feed you. Are you satisfied now?”

Gu Xianer responds with a bright smile, “Ok, I am waiting at the table. Wash yourself up and then come.”

  

While washing his face, Fang Yuan stares at the water in the bucket and observes his reflection. Suddenly, his innocent eyes turn into an endless abyss of darkness.

Administrator Fang Yuan says indifferently, “You have grabbed it quickly.” 

Logical Fang Yuan responds indifferently, “So, I have a lot of restrictions on me. If I want to do something, I need the subconscious permission of both the Balanced Fang Yuan and the illogical Fang Yuan. Balanced Fang Yuan hasn’t fully developed himself. When he completes his development, he will become the default personality. He could do anything that is subconsciously permitted by illogical Fang Yuan. He doesn’t need my subconscious permission.”

Administrator Fang Yuan says, “Illogical Fang Yuan could do anything he wants. He doesn’t need permission. But you need subconscious permission to act. A while before, you tried to kill Gu Xianer but couldn’t do anything. Because Illogical Fang Yuan doesn’t support it. You three are just personalities with your own consciousness. If certain conditions are met, the personality will automatically switch. Now let's see how you manipulate your other personalities and regain your strength. It will be really interesting.”

  

After finishing the meal, Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer go to the academy together. While walking on the streets, Gu Xianer always holds Fang Yuan’s hand. She always talks nonstop with a bright smile. While talking, she hears people saying, “Look, this is the girl who directly opened her aperture with rank 1 middle stage cultivation.” “I heard that all the light of the cave had been absorbed by her.”

Suddenly, someone says with a loud voice, “I have heard that his big brother Fang Yuan is a D-grade trash. I heard that Gu Xianer hasn’t advanced any rank since his awakening. It is said that Gu Xianer could never advance any realms because of Fang Yuan. He is a trash who could never see the face of rank two holding his sister back. If he really loves his sister, he should make distance from her. Gu Xianer could never advance if Fang Yuan doesn’t leave her.”

  

Gu Xianer shouts, “What are you talking about? Don’t you have any work to do? Do you want to be bitten by me?” Fang Yuan gently pulls her hand and says in a shaky voice while tears are about to fall from his eyes, “Let’s go. We will be late.”

  

In the classroom, Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer sit on the first bench, and they sit together. Others start mocking, “Look, this Fang Yuan is a D-grade trash and doesn’t have any future. So, he is also dragging her sister down with him. His sister is the most talented, but she hasn’t made any progress.” “Even some C grades have already caught her.” A girl says shyly, “Look at Fang Zheng. He is already in the Rank 1 upper stage. He is really cool.” 

  

Fang Zheng casually looks at Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer and ponders, “So, I was maintaining caution to double check everything. It looks like I can easily manipulate everything and also could attain everything. Now I am absorbing the Flower Wine Monk’s inharitage. Fang Yuan is really stupid. Now I am even feeling pity for him. But I will never forget my pain and suffering. I have already started my plan. It is working perfectly. Everyone is mocking Fang Yuan, and it is giving me so much pleasure. Now, the Academy elder and Gu Xianer are my crucial pawns. The academy elder is already dancing on my hand. Today he might act. Gu Xianer is a bit troublesome. I have tried to manipulate her in many ways, but there is no progress. I think I have no other choice; you have forced me to do it.”

  

Suddenly, the academy elder enters the classroom. Everyone stops talking and pays their respect. Then the academy elder starts his teaching. While teaching, the elder says, “Look at Fang Zheng. He has already reached the rank 1 upper stage. Gu Yue Mo Bei and Gu Yue Chi Chen have also reached the rank 1 upper stage after 2 weeks. All A and B grade talents have already reached rank 1 upper stage except Gu Xianer, and most of the C grade talents have already reached rank 1 middle stage. Suddenly, the academy elder asks Gu Xianer, “Do you know that you are the most talented among all?" You have absorbed all the Hope Gu and directly opened your aperture at rank 1 middle stage. You are a god-gifted talent. I know you love your brother. There is nothing wrong with it. But you can’t wait for your brother to progress.” Then the academy elder looks at Fang Yuan with pity and says, “It is a pity that you are only a D-grade talent, but you don’t need to worry about anything because you have shown great intelligence from childhood. I believe that God has given you this much intelligence so that you could assist your brother and sister to attain their success. If they become successful, it would be your success. You should encourage your sister to show her true potential. I don’t want to say it, but I think Gu Xianer should sit with Fang Zheng. They are the most talented; in this way, they could compete with each other. I thought that Gu Xianer would be the first to advance to the rank 1 upper stage. But she hasn’t even made any progress in the past few months. I know it is hard, but you should know that as a D-grade talent, you may never reach rank 2. You should accept reality and shouldn’t hold your sister back.”

  

Gu Xianer wants to say something, but Fang Yuan stops her and says, “I understand, academy elder. I will do what you said.” Gu Xianer insists and says, “But brother, I..." Fang Yuan interrupts Gu Xianer and says gently, “Don’t worry. I am fine.” Suddenly, Fang Zheng shouts with determination, “Academy elder, you don’t have to be wary. I know my brother very well. His intelligence will be helpful in the future. No matter what’s happened, he is my big brother, and he will always be my big brother. From my childhood, my brother always took good care of us. I and Gu Xianer will help our big brother. I believe our brother will make an example. He will someday make everyone proof wrong. Our big brother will prove that talent doesn’t matter if one has strong determination. What do you think, Gu Xianer?”

  

Gu Xianer responds excitedly, “Yes, you are right. Everyone of you will envy my big brother. You all will see, one day, how my brother will become a high and almighty immortal. Then I will see how you again say that my brother is a trash. Actually, you are all trash before my brother.” Fang Yuan tries to stop Gu Xianer. Fang Zheng looks at Gu Xianer and ponders, “This is good. Everything is going according to my plan.” The academy elder becomes stupified and quickly calms her down.
