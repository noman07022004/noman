The sun dips below the horizon, painting the landscape in hues of deep crimson and molten gold as Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer tread the winding mountain road back to their village. The air grows cooler, carrying a faint whisper of the encroaching night. Gu Xianer’s tiny hand clings to Fang Yuan’s, her chatter a lively contrast to the tranquil surroundings.

“Brother, next time, let’s bring snacks and a ladder! We could have a picnic on the clouds!” she chirps, her voice brimming with childlike wonder.

Fang Yuan raises an eyebrow, smirking slightly. “A picnic on the clouds? That’s a bit ambitious, don’t you think?”

“But you’re a Gu Master now! Can’t you catch a cloud and bring it to me?” she insists, her big, sparkling eyes staring up at him. “Just a small one! I promise I won’t ask for a big cloud!”

Fang Yuan suppresses a laugh, shaking his head. “Clouds aren’t solid, Xianer. You can’t sit on them.”

She pouts, puffing out her cheeks in indignation. “Then make them solid! You’re always reading about Gu worms. You can invent one, right? A ‘cloud-holding Gu worm’—see? I even named it for you!”

He sighs, shaking his head, though there’s a hint of amusement in his tone. “You really think I can just make any Gu worm I want?”

“Of course you can!” she declares confidently. “And if you can’t, then one day, I’ll make it myself! You’ll see!”

Fang Yuan chuckles softly. “Alright, alright. One day, your brother will bring you a cloud. But for now, let’s focus on walking.”

Gu Xianer grins, satisfied, before pointing at the horizon. “Brother, do you think we can catch the sunset too? It would look so pretty in a jar!”

Fang Yuan raises a brow. “Catch the sunset? Xianer, that’s even more impossible than catching a cloud.”

“No, it’s not!” she insists, stomping her foot lightly. “We just need a really big jar. Or maybe a shiny Gu worm that can trap light!”

Fang Yuan shakes his head in mock defeat. “Fine, fine. I’ll catch the sunset for you too. Anything else you want while we’re at it?”

“Yes!” she chirps, beaming. “I want a star! A small one that glows softly. It’ll make a perfect nightlight for my room!”

“Stars are giant balls of fire,” Fang Yuan explains patiently, his tone bordering on a lecture. “You can’t keep one in your room, no matter how small it is.”

“Then get me a baby star,” she says, crossing her arms as though it’s the most logical solution in the world. “A tiny one that isn’t too hot yet!”

Fang Yuan pinches the bridge of his nose. “A baby star? That’s not how stars work.”

“Why not?” she counters, tilting her head. “Everything else has babies. Why can’t stars?”

“I suppose you have a point,” Fang Yuan concedes, a wry smile tugging at his lips. “One day, your brother will bring you a baby star too. Anything else?”

Gu Xianer’s face lights up, her imagination in full swing. “Oh! I want a rainbow bridge to the next mountain! And a bird that can sing stories! And—”

Fang Yuan interrupts her with a soft chuckle, ruffling her hair. “Alright, alright. One day, your brother will get you all those things. But for now, how about we focus on getting back to the village before it gets too dark?”

She nods eagerly, clutching his hand tighter. “Okay! But you promised, Brother. Don’t forget!”

Fang Yuan smiles faintly, a rare warmth in his eyes. “I won’t forget. One day, I’ll bring you everything you’ve ...”

His words die in her throat as five men suddenly emerge from the rocks ahead, their appearances as menacing as predators stalking helpless prey. Their clothes are ragged, their faces unkempt, and their eyes gleam with predatory intent. Cruel smiles twist their faces, their gazes locking onto Gu Xianer like wolves sizing up a lamb.

“Well, well,” one of them sneers, his voice dripping with malice. “What do we have here? A little bird wandering too far from the nest.”

Fang Yuan instinctively steps in front of Gu Xianer, shielding her with his body. His heart pounds like a drum, but he forces himself to stay calm, his sharp eyes scanning for any possible escape.

Before he can act, a rustling sound from behind makes him whirl around. Five more men emerge from the bushes and rocks, effectively trapping them. The leader of this group steps forward, his smile widening into something grotesque.

“Looks like we’ve hit the jackpot today,” he says, his tone oozing with mockery. “Today, That little lady will make our night... enjoyable.” His words drip with malice, and the others laugh, their eyes filled with vile intentions.

Gu Xianer’s grip on Fang Yuan’s hand tightens, her small body trembling behind him. She looks up at him with wide, terrified eyes, her voice a whisper. “Brother... what do we do?”

---
Fang Yuan clenches his jaw, his mind racing quickly. He has never been in this kind of situation. In his previous life, he was a scholar and in his current life he is just a normal boy who is desperately trying to give his sister a good life. Even though he has an investigation type Gu worm and a movement type Gu worm, he has no experience of using them properly. His mind has stopped working. He tries to thinks many ways but can't any because they are surrounded from all direction.

The bandits start to close in, their laughter echoing against the rocky walls. “Hey pretty girl, come to your uncle. We are good people. We will take good care of you. Don't be afraid of us. If we get satisfied, we might give you some gift. and anyway you will get pleasure from a lot of uncles.”

Hearing those word, Fang Yuan tries to shouts but he can't as if his mouth has lost to utter a single word or sound from fear. He is not fearing about his death that much, rather he is fearful about his sister, Gu Xianer. He unknowing tries to shield Gu Xianer.

A bandit shouts, "Why are you wasting your time? We are in the Gu Yue clan's area. Anyone can come at any time. Don't take any risk. Just kill the boy and take the girl."

The previous bandit responds, "You are thinking too much. You and I are both rank 2 Gu master and the other 8 are rank 1 Gu Master. We can even kill a rank 3 Gu Master. And It is not like we are going to stay in Qing Mao Mountain. We will leave this mountain tomorrow. So, even creating a scene won't matter. So, don't worry."

A middle-aged bandit says, "You are right. It is a long time that we has had proper fun. If we just kill that boy it won't be enjoyable. How about he enjoy his sister before his eyes. Think about this, his sister is shouting with pain but as a brother he can do nothing. Don't you think it is enjoyable. It would be even more enjoyable if we let him also join with us to let him enjoy her sister. he he he."

Fang Yuan’s heart races, fears is eminent in his face. He raises his shaky voice “We’re from the Gu Yue Clan. If you harm us, the clan will hunt you down to the ends of the earth.”

The leader chuckles darkly. “Oh, we know who you are, boy. That’s exactly why we’re here. By the time your clan hears about this, it’ll be too late for you. And as for the girl—” his eyes flicker to Gu Xianer, making her shudder—“She is really cute. It would be a regret for our lifetime if we let her go. Even if she is the daughter of you clan head, we would enjoy her even more with our heart content. As it would be added to our achievement list.”

Fang Yuan shouts, "How about you take everything that we have but let us go."

The bandits responds, "That would be our bonus that we would get anyway afterward."

Fang Yuan shouts, "How about you this, we will provide you more that 100 primeval stones right now and you let her go. And I will be hear as you hostage. You can ask anything from our clan. Our clan would fulfil it. while crying loudly he add Just let her go, take all the primeval stone and gu worms that we have and do whatever you want with me!" Then Fang Yuan throws the pouch of primeval stone that he had toward the bandits.

One of the bandits, checking the pouch, demands with a cruel grin, “What’s this? Primeval stones? and that many! may be more that 50!” His voice rises, full of suspicion. “If you’re carrying that many, you are not from ordinary background, right?”

Hearing this, Fang Yuan shouts, "Yes, you are right. Our uncle is a very powerful elder in the clan. If anything happens to us, you all will be dead. So, take everything that we have and let us go. If you do that, I will asks my uncle to not sent anyone after you all."

The bandits' eyes gleam darkly, and with a sneer, he motions for his men to surround them and one of them says “If you have this many primeval stone which means you have many Gu worms as well and your uncle is a powerful elder in the clan. So that mean you two possess some threat.”

Hearing this Fang Yuan feels a hope, with this hope he shouts, "Yes, our elder gives us powerful gu worms. If you attacks us, we will also attacks you and our gu worms is very powerful. So let us go."

Suddenly, the leader launch an attack at Fang Yuan while shouting, "Everyone kills them quickly. If we waste our time or give them chance, we might be in great danger. Don't give them any chance to counter attack if you don't want to lose you life."

Hearing this, Fang Yuan can't thing anything. He has only investigating and movement types Gu worms , so all of these Gu worms can’t help them in a fight like this. He unconsciously grabs Gu Xianer violently and push her down on the ground and lay on her. The attack hits Fang Yuan. 

"Don't show any merchy to the boy. Just kill him. Even if the girls dies, it doesn't matter as ling as we can get the body, we could enjoy at lest."

More arrows rain down, a relentless storm of death. Fang Yuan lays on Gu Xianer and uses his body as a shield and his two hands to cover her head so that she doesn’t get injured. One by one attacks start hitting Fang Yuan, which causes him intense pain, and he can’t take it anymore and faints on the spot. Even after fainting, he continues to grab Gu Xianer tightly. Gu Xianer was crying loudly a moment before, but now she can’t even say a single thing, and her eyes are wide open. Even though tears are falling like streams from her eyes, there is no sound in her crying.

The attackers pause their attack for a moment to check the result of their attacks. Even they become stupified after seeing the lifeless body of Fang Yuan, who was desperately saving his sister using his body without even using any Gu worm. His body condition was so bad and horrifying that even for a moment they got scared. The most deadly injury is in the head that causes his skull to turn apart, and the brain could be seen. Even in his backbone, his internal organs are popping out. The skeleton of his body is visible in many areas, which makes it even more horrifying. 

Gu Xianer, trapped beneath Fang Yuan’s lifeless form, sobs uncontrollably, her small hands clutching his bloodied shirt. Her cries pierce the cold night, a heartbreaking melody of despair that the mountains carry far and wide.

Gu Xianer desperately uses her healing Gu worm, even though there is no visible difference but she still continues to use while crying desperately.

The bandits linger like vultures, their wicked eyes trained on the lifeless body of Fang Yuan and the trembling figure of Gu Xianer. The scene before them is painted in blood and despair, and yet they wear smirks, as though relishing the misery they’ve wrought.

One of them, his voice laced with cruel satisfaction, finally speaks. “The boy’s done for. No point waiting. Let’s grab the girl and have some fun. Her cries will make the night even sweeter.”

Another chuckles darkly. “Right, no more delays. She’s too soft and tender to leave here. It’d be a waste.”

Gu Xianer, oblivious to their sinister intent, kneels beside Fang Yuan’s lifeless body, her tiny frame shivering with each ragged breath. Her hands, covered in his blood, desperately try to activate her healing Gu worm over and over, though it’s clear it’s futile.

“Brother… please,” she whispers, her voice hoarse and broken. Tears stream down her face, mixing with the dirt and blood smeared across her cheeks. Her fingers tremble, but she refuses to stop. “Don’t leave me! You promised! You said you’d bring me the clouds one day…”

The attackers approach, their steps slow and deliberate. One of them crouches down and grabs her wrist, his fingers tightening cruelly around it. “Enough of this drama, little girl. He’s dead. Cry all you want—it won’t bring him back.”

Gu Xianer recoils, trying to pull away, her voice trembling with defiance. “Let me go! My brother… he’s not dead! He can’t be!” Her protests are pitiful, weak, and ignored.

“Shut up,” the man sneers, his grip tightening. “You’ll cry louder soon enough.”

Another bandit laughs, his voice cold and hollow. “What’s the point of all this? Just knock her out and let’s go. We’ve wasted enough time already.”

Before Gu Xianer can react, the man yanks her forward and strikes the back of her neck with brutal efficiency. Her small body crumples instantly, collapsing like a broken doll. The healing Gu worm slips from her fingers, its faint glow fading as it rolls onto the blood-soaked dirt.

The man slings her unconscious form over his shoulder, her arms dangling lifelessly. Her once-bright eyes are now shut, her face pale and stained with tears.

“Let’s move,” the leader commands coldly, turning toward the shadowy mountains. “The night is ours.”

As they retreat into the dark wilderness, their laughter echoes cruelly, a chilling contrast to the deathly silence left behind. The mountains swallow them whole, their figures disappearing into the oppressive darkness.

Left behind, Fang Yuan’s mangled body lies in a pool of blood, motionless and broken. His injuries are grotesque, his face unrecognizable, and his once-bright eyes stare lifelessly at the night sky. The ground beneath him is soaked red, a silent testament to his sacrifice.

The moon rises, casting a pale light over the scene, illuminating the stark reality of the tragedy. The wind carries the scent of blood, and the eerie stillness of the mountain path feels suffocating. Fang Yuan’s body grows cold under the open sky, while Gu Xianer, the sister he died protecting, is carried deeper into the heartless void of the mountains.

The world moves on, indifferent to their suffering. The stars twinkle above, mocking in their distant beauty, while the lifeless corpse of Fang Yuan and the stolen innocence of Gu Xianer are left as mere remnants of a cruel and uncaring night.
