The next day, Gu Xianer wakes up early in the morning. She finds herself embracing Fang Yuan. She gets a bit confused because every morning Fang Yuan wakes up first then make her wake up. But today is an awakening ceremony which is very important event but his brother is sleeping soundly. She thinks that Fang Yuan might be tired and so she doesn't disturb him. 

She washes herself alone which isn't the case for other days. On other days, first Fang Yuan wakes up and then clean himself up, afterward he wakes up Gu Xianer gently and helps her clean up. Just like a mother who is taking care of her beloved child. 

Even after some times, The breakfast is ready but Fang Yuan doesn't wake up. The servants along with aunt start talking, "It looks like Gu Xianer is making things difficult for his brother. She must have eaten up all her brother's meal last day. So, Fang Yuan is tired and haven't wake up. For her, Fang Yuan can't even have a proper meal. Now, she must be happy thinking she can devour his brother's breakfast. Really monstrous! A child and girl like her must be a curse. I am felling really sad about her future husband. Her future husband would become poor just by feeding her. Ha ha ha."

Hearing all these, tears come our from her eyes but suddenly she recalls Fang Yuan's teaching and memories flash before her eyes. In the memories,

Aunt says, "Are you a girl or a pig? Who will marry a pig? How can you eat that much food. Were you a hungry beast in your previous life."

Uncle says, "Gu Xianer, you are eating the food of two adults in every meal. Are you not going to get married, who will marry a girl like you?"

they are pretty young. Servants have prepared dinner and served early in the table but gu xianer can't resists and secretly eats from their but caught in the hand of fang zheng and then he shouts, "Can't you control yourself for a few moments. Don't you have any common sense. Always eat eat eat. are you the reincarnation of a food devouring hungry beast!"

Tears automatically come out of her eyes but she know that she has done something wrong. Even the lowly servants of the house mocks her. She wants to control herself but always forget after seeing food. But along all these mockeries, there is a gentle voice which always defends her. Which always protects her. This voice tells her to fight back.

Recalling all these memories, She gets her courage and shouts, "No one needs to marry me. I will marry my brother. I know, If I ask my brother to marry me, he will do it. He will never abandon me."

Suddenly, hearing Gu Xianer's shouts to defend herself everyone around her become stupefied. Afterward, without waiting for any responds she run toward Fang Yuan's room.

She is extremely nervous because this is her first time giving an answer to all her criticism. While approaching Fang Yuan's room, she ponders to herself, "I am not a good girl. I always cause trouble for my brother. Do I really deserve my brother? Will my brother marry me if I ask him. Or should I just disappear somehow so that I don't create any problems for my brother." But seeing Fang Yuan sleeping soundly washes away all her pains and thoughts. 
Then she ponders, "Brother doesn't usually sleep that much. Am I really the reason. No, my brother would tell me if I was the reason. That means he just forget to wake up. It looks like, I have to wake my brother up."

Then she starts strolling around the bed while thinking, "Today I will be helpful to my brother. No, from today onward, I will wake up early and then wake my brother up. And then I will be the one to help clean up my brother and from today onward I will be the one who will feed my brother and I will not all my brother to feed me. Because, he always feeds me not only my parts but also his parts. Sometime, he doesn't even take a single bite. And I don't know why I always forget about this while eating. Now, How should I wake my brother up. I have a good idea."

Then Gu Xianer comes very close to Fang Yuan's face and starts tapping his face with her cute little finger but he doesn't wake up. Seeing no result, she moves her mouth very close to his ear and says gently, "Brother wake up, B-r-o-t-h-e-r w-a-k-e u-p. The breakfast is ready. Everyone has already started eating. And we will me late for our awakening ceremony. Even then Fang Yuan doesn't wake up."

After thinking for a while, Gu Xianer gives a devilish but cute smile and the mumbles to herself, "Don't blame me for what I am going to do with you. he he he!" Then, with one of her small and soft hands, she grabs Fang Yuan's nose closed and with the other hand she grabs his lips closed so that he can't take breath by using both his nose and mouth. At the same time, she moves her mouth very close to Fang Yuan's ear and shouts, "B-I-G B-R-O-T-H-E-R, W-A-K-E U-P!"

Fang Yuan, startled awake up by the sudden lack of air and the loud sound in his ear, blinks groggily as his eyes adjust to the sight of Gu Xianer's mischievous smile hovering over him. He sights deeply, clearly torn between frustration and fondness. Rubbing his eyes, Fang Yuan grumbles, "Xianer, do you wake me up or try to end my life?" His tone, though hard, carries a trace of affection. Hearing this, Gu Xianer puffs her cheeks in anger and declares, "Brother, you haven't told me any story because to day is the awakening ceremony. So, you told me that we have to wake up early but look what have you done. You should thank be for waking you up." Seeing her anger, Fang Yuan laughs quietly and taps her forehead gently and says, "You are right my princess. It is really strange why have I now wake up on time. No problem, sometimes this kind of thing happens. You bring the breakfast here. I’ll freshen up first, then eat with you while feeding you."

Fang Yuan has been feeding her since the age of 4. And even though they are now 15 but they continues this. The main reason for feeding her up because even though she was only 4 she would eat the meal of two adult male. And even more it looks like she is a dull who doesn't have maturity or intelligence accordance with her age. Everyone around her criticizes her, mocks her, ostracize her for this two reason. These kind of insulting and mocking intensifies during eating meal at the same table. So, to prevent her from facing all these, Fang Yuan decided to feed her separately in his room.

In Fang Zheng's room, Fang Zheng returns to his room after finishing his breakfast. He looks extremely happy. While looking at people going through the road, Fang Zheng ponders, "I have already made my plan for my future. And I have already decided how I am going to become venerable quickly and in which path I will become venerable. I will make a clear plan at night as the result of the awakening ceremony will determine my plan. There is a possibility of change. I don't want to think too much. After confirming Fang Yuan's current situation, I am feeling excited about my future. Even I have double check Fang Yuan in the morning and it was normal which means I can use him as I want ha ha ha. Last night with Shen Cui was really enjoyable as I was tensed up thinking about thinking it might not be his first life before. I can't blame her for her character as I am the one who has given her this personality. Ha ha ha."

In Fang Yuan's room, Fang Yuan has finished his breakfast with Gu Xianer. In reality, Fang Yuan has at best taken 3 bites most. Gu Xianer hasn't noticed anything as she was absorbed in Fang Yuan's story. After finishing the meal, Fang Yuan ponders, "I was regretful because of being a scholar in my previous life. The primary reason was money. But now I am really happy that I was an scholar as I can tell her endless stories. If I run out of stories, I just create one. She likes my stories because I tell only the story that is her type. She mostly like brother and sister going on an adventure, brother and sister save each other, when I tell stories on little sister helping brother or how big sister rises up her little brother, she becomes extremely attentive and tries to apply them. Through stories I also teach her how to defend herself. I am really happy having a sister like her. I don't know what would be my purpose of become strong if I haven't had Gu Xianer. As she hasn't matured enough for her age, It is possible she might have low talent for cultivation but I hope at least she has B grade talent for cultivation. I am also expecting myself of having high talent for cultivation. I am a bit nervous, but I need to be strong regardless of the result for my sister as she might face even more criticize or mocking. If they mock or criticize me, it is ok, as I can handle these all but she is just a child. It would be really hard for her."

The morning sun bathed the Gu Clan's lush surroundings in a golden glow. The three siblings—Fang Yuan, Gu Xianer, and Fang Zheng—strolled along the path leading to the clan pavilion. The air was crisp, and the distant hum of nature filled the silence, broken only by the crunch of gravel beneath their feet.

Gu Xianer, cheerful as ever, clung tightly to Fang Yuan’s hand, her small fingers interlocked with his. She swung their joined hands back and forth as they walked, her light steps filled with boundless energy.

"Big Brother Fang Yuan, do you think they will give us sweets after the awakening ceremony?" Gu XIaner asked, her voice bright with hope. She is as cheerful and bright as ever. 

Fang Yuan responds with affection, "Don't worry? After awakening our talent, we can have as much sweet as we want. After becoming gu master, I will bring all the things that you want to eat. Now, listen carefully. You should keep silent at the awakening ceremony as it is very important."

Hearing the conversation between Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer, Fang Zheng ponders, "This girl is really a low intelligent hungry pig. She can't even understand the situation. Just eating and eating all the time. There is a saying, love is a trap of mind, where reason is sacrificed, intelligence dims, and unnecessary suffering becomes self-inflicted. I was trapped in my previous life thinking my wife and son are my life. Now, if I look at Fang Yuan, I understand how dull I was! If he doesn't love Gu Xianer, he could have live a more comfortable life and now would have held as a genius. I am really eager of seeing his despair after finding out he has only low talent for cultivation. He will feel even more despair then what I have written as he has created his own weakness. he he he. I will make you feel even more despair that I have felt in my previous life for you, Fang Yuan. It is good that Fang Yuan has become very naive and lost his reasoning after getting this low iq pig. Now, I can easily manipulate them. Don't worry, I will use both of you properly and squeeze out all your worth." 
Thinking all this he unconsciously start laughing loudly like a devil. Hearing his laughter, Fang Yuan says, "Hey Fang Zheng, don't laugh loudly as we are before the clan pavilion and the elder is watching us. I know you are excited but please control your excitement."
Hearing this, Fang Zheng snaps out of his thinking and becomes very serious.
