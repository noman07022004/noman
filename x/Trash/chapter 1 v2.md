Fang Zheng stands by the window, gazing at the moon as he mumbles to himself, "I’ve reincarnated into my own novel, the one I hated so much before my death. It’s been a month since my reincarnation. Most things are as I wrote them, but there’s one major change I never anticipated."

Frustration wells up inside him, and he clenches his fists tightly. His mind roars, "Why do I have a sister? In my novel, I wrote that character/-/Fang Yuan and I would be twins, so why are we triplets now? Where did this sister, Gu Xianer, even come from? Is Gu Xianer part of Heaven's Will's design to throw me off course? How much does it know about my every step? Did Heaven’s Will know I would come to this world into Fang Zheng's body, just like it knew Fang Yuan would enter this world? This is terrifying."

He takes a deep breath, calming himself for a moment before his frustration resurges. "If I had known I’d reincarnate into my own story, I wouldn’t have given Heaven’s Will this much power. But at least I didn’t make it capable of reading human thoughts or directly acting against me. It can only manipulate the people around me, but it can’t touch me. After all, I am the creator of this entire Gu World. Ha ha ha!"

Hearing Fang Zheng's devilish laughter echoing through the shadowy, dimly lit room, Shen Cui’s heart races, and fear creeps into her voice as she asks, "Young Master, is something wrong?"

Fang Zheng snaps back to reality at the sound of her voice, his mind shifting focus as he turns to look at her. For a brief moment, confusion crosses his face before it clears, and he thinks, "I completely forgot about another major change. Shen Cui is now my personal maid, and she even stays with me at night. Meanwhile, Fang Yuan stays with Gu Xianer in his room. I’ve inherited the memories of the real Fang Zheng, and I recall how naive he used to complain about Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer always being together while he was left alone. After Fang Zheng's complaints, Fang Yuan, as a mature scholar from his previous life, had suggested giving Gu Xianer a separate room. However, despite being a triplet, she cried like a baby, forcing Fang Yuan to make other arrangements. In the end, Fang Yuan decided Shen Cui would stay with me instead."

Suddenly, Shen Cui rises slowly from the bed, her movements graceful yet deliberate. She steps closer to Fang Zheng, her presence near him, her warm breath brushing against his ear. In a low, seductive whisper, she speaks softly, "Young master, let me help you relax tonight, just like before. I feel a burning desire inside me, young master. Please, allow your servant to serve you tonight. You've been so anxious these past few days with the awakening ceremony approaching. I’m certain you’ll awaken high talent, so there’s no need to worry."

Hearing her words, Fang Zheng suddenly recalls something and as a result his breath catches, his body tensing as if faced with an unseen monster. For a moment, his mind spirals, but he quickly forces himself to breathe deeply and regain control. He mumbles to himself, "I’ve completely forgotten why I’m so anxious. Tomorrow is the awakening ceremony, and it’s already late at night. Why am I feeling so nervous and afraid? I am the creator of Fang Yuan! How can I be so cowardly? I am the creator of everything in this world. There’s nothing in this world that can make me fear."

A wave of frustration washes over him as he refocuses his thoughts. "I need to check on Fang Yuan right now. The weather is exactly as I described in my novel—cold with light rain. If the events unfold as I wrote them, then Fang Yuan has already returned to the past. But I hope this is still his first life in the Gu World, where he’s a naive amateur who doesn’t understand how this world works. I need a good excuse to go and check."

In Fang Yuan’s room, the cold night air drifts in, with light rain tapping softly against the window. Gu Xianer, shivering slightly, looks up at her older brother and says with a bright smile, "Brother, don't worry. You'll see—we'll awaken high talent."

Fang Yuan glances at her, his concern clear as he notices her shaking from the cold. "It's quite cold tonight, isn't it? Look at you, you're shivering."

Gu Xianer quickly tries to hide her trembling, her voice firm but playful. "Who’s shivering? You’re the one who’s shaking! I'm not cold!"

Fang Yuan lets out a soft sigh, his tone gentle but filled with care. "Alright, stop pretending. You don't need to be shy or feel guilty. Just take part of my blanket."

she says with a laugh, though a tremor in her voice betrays her. "Who’s feeling shy? If I need it, I’ll take it from you. Got it?"

Fang Yuan chuckles softly, shaking his head. "I know you're feeling guilty about the times you took my whole blanket, and I was left shivering. Just take part of it. Don’t worry, I won’t let you steal it all. You’ll catch a cold if you don’t."

Gu Xianer’s face turns slightly red, a mix of frustration and childish pouting. "You always say the same thing. Even when I ask you to let me hug you, you say there's a difference between men and women. I'm not a woman, I’m a girl. If I don’t get another blanket, I’ll catch a cold. And if you don’t let me hug you, I won’t take it!"

Fang Yuan sighs, his expression softening as he looks at his little sister. "Alright, my princess, you’ve won today. Come here and take the blanket."

Without hesitation, Gu Xianer leaps into his arms, hugging him tightly as if she’s been waiting for this moment forever. "Brother, tell me a story."

Fang Yuan gently strokes her hair, his voice calm but firm. "No stories tonight. We need to wake up early for the awakening ceremony tomorrow."

Gu Xianer looks at him with concern in her eyes. "Brother, you seem worried. Don’t be. We’ll awaken high talent, and one day, we’ll become immortals."

Fang Yuan smiles softly at her, his heart heavy with thoughts of her future. "I hope you awaken high talent, Xianer. You've been through so much because people have always looked down on you for your intelligence. Even though you’re my triplet and 15, you still act so innocent, like you're only five. If you awaken high talent, no one will ever belittle you again. In my past life, I was a scholar, an orphan with no family. Even though I married and had children, I never felt this warmth of having a little sister. Don’t worry, Xianer. No matter what talent you awaken, I’ll protect you. I now understand what it means to be a big brother, and I will always stand by you."

His eyes soften as he gazes at her, a tenderness in his heart that he has never known before.

Gu Xianer, sensing the warmth in his gaze, asks with a curious expression, "Big Brother, what are you thinking?"

Fang Yuan’s voice is full of hope as he looks into her eyes. "I’m thinking about how my princess will one day become a mighty Gu Immortal, just like the legends we’ve heard."

Gu Xianer’s eyes shine with determination, her voice steady and full of confidence. "Yes, we’ll awaken high talent, and we’ll shock everyone around us. No one will ever be able to look down on us again."

Suddenly, Fang Zheng enters the room, holding a lamp in his hand, the air seems to chill, the flickering light from the lamp casting distorted shadows on the walls. Fang Zheng’s voice breaks the silence—low and chilling, his face serious as he says, "Yes, you’re right. We will awaken high talent and become immortal one day, and then no one will be able to look down on us."

Gu Xianer, sensing his presence, turns to him and asks, "Yes, you're right. But little brother, why are you here at this late hour? Go sleep with Shen Cui. I won't allow you to sleep with us."

Fang Zheng feels an intense wave of fear wash over him, his body trembling. He struggles to compose himself and, after a pause, walks toward Fang Yuan while saying, "Big brother, I thought you might have forgotten that tomorrow is the awakening ceremony. I came here to remind you not to tell stories to Gu Xianer. She won’t wake up in time if you do."

Fang Yuan responds casually, "I know, but thanks for the reminder. Gu Xianer asked me to tell her a story, but I refused."

Summoning the courage to meet Fang Yuan’s gaze, Fang Zheng sighs deeply, as if coming back from the brink of death.

Noticing his condition, Fang Yuan asks with concern, "Are you sure you're alright? You don’t look well at all."

Fang Zheng waves it off, forcing a faint smile. "It’s nothing. Just a little worried. Anyway, I’ll take my leave. You two should sleep quickly. We need to wake up early tomorrow."

As Fang Zheng exits, he ponders to himself, "Those weren't the eyes of a terrifying demon who’s returned from the future. This must be Fang Yuan’s first timeline in the Gu World. Even though his personality isn’t exactly how I wrote it, I can still manipulate and control him. I can understand why his personality has changed. The main reason is Gu Xianer. From the memories I’ve inherited, I see Gu Xianer as a naive girl with low intelligence. Her monstrous hunger for food has caused her much ridicule, from Aunt and Gu Yue Dong Tu to the servants. But she’s so young... How could he not act protectively? He hasn’t had the chance to show off his poetry skills to anyone because he’s been busy protecting her. Ha ha ha."

His laughter grows louder, echoing against the walls like a man who knows the threads of fate are finally in his hands. Shen Cui, sensing the change in his demeanor, hesitantly asks, "Young master, has something good happened?"

Fang Zheng doesn't answer her, instead, he quickly turns off the lamp, casting the room into a deeper darkness. His voice grows low and unsettling as he says, "I am really happy. Tonight, I am going to devour you. Ha ha ha."

Shen Cui, despite the eerie tone in Fang Zheng’s voice, feels a strange excitement stir within her. Her cheeks flush, and she responds with a soft, almost eager smile, her voice tinged with anticipation, "Yes, young master, I am ready." Her voice trembles, but there's something almost eager in it—a strange anticipation she cannot fully hide.
