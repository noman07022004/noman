In the kitchen,

Fang Yuan helps Gu Xianer directly while Gu Wang and Yao Le help prepare everything. Gu Xianer looks excited because she has been practicing this dish for several days without proper rest. She wants to cook for her brother. So, there is no servant for help. Only Gu Wang and Yao Le are helping as they are Gu Xianer’s close friends.

“Brother you don’t have to keep standing there like a shadow,” Gu Xianer grumbles, glancing over her shoulder at Fang Yuan, who is casually standing near her.

“I am just here in case you need help,” Fang Yuan replies, his tone calm yet teasing. “Considering what I have heard from your friends about what you did last time, someone needs to keep an eye on you.” Gu Xianer looks at Gu Wang and Yao Le and gives them an angry glance and then tells Fang Yuan, “I was a little bit careless. You don’t have to worry.”

Nearby, Gu Wang snickers as she chops vegetables.

Despite their teasing, the two friends work diligently to prepare the ingredients under Gu Xianer’s careful directions. Fang Yuan watches silently, a faint smile on his lips. His little sister’s determination is endearing, but it also worries him. She is pushing herself too hard.

Just as the mood lightened, disaster struck.

Gu Xianer is heating oil in a cooking pot when she accidentally knocks over. Startled, she reaches instinctively to catch it. The cooking pot shakes precariously, sending a wave of boiling hot oil toward her.

“Xianer, Stop!” Fang Yuan’s voice cut through the air like a blade.

In an instant, he steps in front of her, shielding her with her arm. The oil splashes across his forearm, creating blistered, raw, and searing with pain, its flesh marred by swollen, angry burns.

“Big brother!” Gu Xianer’s scream echoes in the kitchen as she freezes in shock.

Fang Yuan bit back the pain, quickly pulling her away from the stove. “Are you hurt?” he asked, his voice steady despite the burn.

“I—no! But you—” Her eyes filled with tears as she noticed the angry red welts forming on his arm. “This is my fault! I—”

“It’s nothing,” Fang Yuan interrupted firmly, guiding her to sit down. “I’ve been through worse. You, however, need to be more careful.”

Gu Xianer’s tears spilled over, and she buried her face in her hands. “I just wanted to do something nice for you, and now I’ve hurt you! I’m so useless!”

Fang Yuan kneels before her, gently pulling her hands away from her face. “Xianer, listen to me. You’re not useless. You’ve worked so hard, and that means more to me than any dish. Accidents happen. What matters is that you’re safe.”

“But—”“

No buts,” he says, his voice softening. “If you want to cry, that’s fine. Just know I’ll always be here to protect you.”

His words only makes her cry harder, and she clings to him, her small arms wrapping around his neck. Gu Wang and Yao Le exchange glances, their teasing forgotten as they quietly tend to the stove.

After a moment, Fang Yuan pulls back, ruffling Gu Xianer’s hair. “Let’s finish this together, okay? I’ll handle the stove. You tell me what to do.”

Sniffling, she nods , her resolve returning. “Okay.”

The four of them work as a team, with Fang Yuan taking over the risky tasks while Gu Xianer directs him with newfound caution. By the time the dish is ready, the kitchen is filled with warmth—not just from the food, but from the bond they shared.

As they sit around the table, Fang Yuan places a piece of food on Gu Xianer’s plate. “For the chef,” he says with a small smile.

Gu Xianer looks at him, her eyes still red from crying, but her smile brighter than ever. “Thank you, big brother.”

And as the first bite brings a chorus of praise, the earlier mishap seems to melt away, leaving only the memory of a family that stands together, even in the face of boiling oil.

Gu Xianer complains to Fang Yuan, “I have wanted to feed you but as always you feed me. Now, take this bite.”

  
  

In the afternoon,

The bustling market was alive with vibrant colors and chatter. Merchants called out their wares, children darted between stalls, and the aroma of freshly baked pastries filled the air. Fang Yuan led the small group, his imposing yet calm demeanor parting the crowd effortlessly.

Gu Xianer walked beside him, her eyes sparkling as they darted from one stall to another. She was like a child in a candy store, her excitement palpable. Gu Wang followed behind, her hands neatly clasped, her composed demeanor betraying only a hint of nervousness as her gaze occasionally flickered to Fang Yuan. Yao Le, meanwhile, practically bounced on her heels, her energy infectious.

“Big brother, look at those hairpins!” Gu Xianer exclaimed, pointing to a stall adorned with delicate accessories.

Fang Yuan glanced at the stall, then at his little sister, a faint smile tugging at his lips. “Let’s take a look.”

As they approached, the vendor eagerly displayed his wares. Gu Xianer picked up a jade hairpin, the intricate carvings catching the light. “Isn’t this beautiful?”

“It is,” Fang Yuan agreed. Without hesitation, he turned to the vendor. “We’ll take it. Wrap it carefully.”

“Big brother, you didn’t even ask the price!” Gu Xianer protested, though her cheeks flushed with delight.

“Price doesn’t matter if it’s for you,” Fang Yuan replied nonchalantly, handing the wrapped package to her.

Gu Xianer’s face turned crimson, and she clutched the package tightly, her heart swelling with warmth.

Nearby, Yao Le was peering at a stall selling small figurines, her curiosity evident. Fang Yuan noticed and walked over. “See something you like?”

Yao Le jumped, her cheeks immediately coloring. “N-no! I was just looking…”

Fang Yuan raised an eyebrow, his tone gentle yet firm. “Which one?”

She hesitated before pointing shyly to a figurine of a fox. “It’s… cute.”

Fang Yuan picked up the figurine, examining it briefly before handing it to the vendor. “Wrap this as well.”

Yao Le stared at him, her face a bright shade of pink. “Y-you don’t have to, really—”

“I insist,” Fang Yuan said, his voice leaving no room for argument. “Consider it a token of thanks for being a good friend to Xianer.”

Yao Le clutched the wrapped figurine as if it were a treasure, her heart racing. “T-thank you!”

Meanwhile, Gu Wang stood silently, her eyes scanning a nearby stall of silk scarves. Fang Yuan caught her glance and approached. “Gu Wang.”

She turned quickly, her composure cracking as a faint blush crept across her face. “Y-yes, young master?”

“Which one do you like?” he asked, his tone straightforward.

“Oh, no, I don’t need—”

Fang Yuan cut her off with a slight smirk. “I didn’t ask if you needed it. I asked which one you liked.”

Gu Wang hesitated, then pointed to a deep blue scarf embroidered with silver stars. Fang Yuan nodded, picked it up, and handed it to the vendor.

“You didn’t have to, young master,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

“I did,” Fang Yuan replied. “You work hard. It’s only fair.”

Gu Wang’s face reddened, and she lowered her gaze, clutching the scarf tightly.

As the group continued through the market, Fang Yuan indulged Gu Xianer’s every whim, from sweet pastries to a small bracelet she admired. Gu Wang and Yao Le trailed behind, their hearts fluttering with every kind gesture he made.

“Big brother, you’re spoiling me too much!” Gu Xianer finally exclaimed, though her tone was light and teasing.

“That’s my job,” Fang Yuan replied, ruffling her hair affectionately. “You’re my little sister, after all.”

Gu Xianer giggled, holding onto his arm. “Then I’ll take full advantage of it!”

By the time they left the market, the group was laden with parcels, and their hearts were full. Fang Yuan’s thoughtful gestures had left each of them feeling valued and cared for.

As they walked back, Yao Le whispered to Gu Wang, “Fang Yuan is so… considerate. It’s hard not to…”

Gu Wang nodded, her cheeks still warm. “I know. He’s… different.”

Unaware of their whispered exchange—or perhaps choosing to ignore it—Fang Yuan walked ahead, his steady presence a comforting anchor for the small group.

And as the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the market, the bonds between them felt stronger than ever.

  

At the evening,

Fang Yuan drops Yao Le to her home with Gu Wang and Gu Xianer. And then returns home with Gu Xianer and Gu Wang. Gu Wang hesitates to enter the room and asks Fang Yuan, “Young Master, I think I should sleep at the servant’s place. You and your sister should have a good time and I am only interrupting you both.” Fang Yuan says, “It doesn’t matter. You stay here with us as you will be the closest one to Gu Xianer.” Gu Xianer asks, “What do you mean by that, big brother?” Fang Yuan responds, “It means, You have become grown-up. Now, you can live without me.” Gu Xianer responds, “What are you talking about? I know I have grown up but I will always live with you.” Then Fang Yuan looks at Gu Wang which makes her blush and orders, “You stay with Gu Xianer. I have some business to do. I will come back after a few hours.” Gu Xianer asks, “Brother are you leaving?” Fang Yuan responds affectionately, “Yes, I am leaving but I will return soon and I will bring good dinner from outside. How about it, you will feed me tonight?” Gu Xianer responds, “Then I am waiting. Come back quickly.” Before leaving, Fang Yuan looks at both Gu Xianer and Gu Wang and says goodbye to them.

  

After a few moments,

Fang Yuan is standing in the medicine hall and the leader of the medicine hall is bowing before Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan asks her, “Have you prepared your granddaughter Yao Le? I have told you that before I leave, I will give her an immortal opportunity as she is Gu Xianer’s close friend.” Medicine hall elder responds, “Yes, I have prepared her and told her not to be shocked. And thank you for showing your kindness to us lowly mortals.” Fang Yuan responds, “I hope that when I visit this town next time, I don’t need to eliminate you all. Now, lead the way.” The elder becomes frightened and shows the way with utmost respect while shaking internally.
