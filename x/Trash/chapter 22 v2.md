Gu Wang stomps ahead, her fists clenched so tight her nails dig into her palms.

Behind her, Gu Xianer follows with small dishes, her delicate face calm, unaware of the **storm** brewing beside her.

The two step into the room.

**Thud!**

Gu Wang **slams** the main dish onto the table right in front of Fang Yuan.

Her eyes **burn with frustration**, her entire body **radiates suppressed rage**.

But—

On the other side, **Wang Er and Old Man Wang nearly jump out of their skins**.

Their eyes dart between Fang Yuan and Gu Wang, their backs soaked in **cold sweat**.

They aren't just _afraid_.

They are **terrified**.

Every time they see **either** Fang Yuan or Gu Xianer, **their minds replay that nightmare**.

Gu Xianer.

Sitting **in a pool of blood**.

Her tiny hands clutching the **mangled, disfigured corpse of Fang Yuan**, her screams piercing the night, raw with agony.

And behind her—

Bandits **rolling on the ground**, clawing at their throats, their bodies **convulsing violently**, **screaming** as **their own blood choked them to death**.

It’s **seared** into their memories.

And now, those **same children** sit before them, **alive and well**.

One sits with an **unknowable smile**, a maniac hidden behind gentle eyes.

The other **innocent yet covered in tragedy**, a demon wrapped in a child’s frame.

What if Fang Yuan gets **angry** next?

What if the **next thing they see** is their own **throats ripped open**?

Wang Er’s hands tremble so badly he grips his knees to steady himself.

Old Man Wang **lowers his head slightly**, barely daring to breathe.

Then—

A **gentle smile** appears on Fang Yuan’s face.

He tilts his head, his voice **soft, warm, disturbingly kind**—

_"Why are you so angry, Gu Wang?"_

Gu Wang glares, refusing to answer.

Instead, she **snatches** a plate from Gu Xianer—gently, without force—before **slamming it down in front of Fang Yuan again**.

She doesn’t stop.

She prepares his food with **rough, forceful movements**.

Her **anger drips** from every motion.

Her **rage burns**, visible in every **clenched jaw, every sharp exhale**.

But—

Wang Er and Old Man Wang **feel their souls leaving their bodies**.

They **can’t understand** why Fang Yuan is _still smiling_.

He watches her with **calm amusement**, his eyes glittering **with something dangerous**.

Then—

Gu Wang **snaps**.

_"Now eat it!"_ she shouts. _"It’s the meat of that **innocent deer!**"_

The room **freezes**.

Fang Yuan’s **smile disappears**.

His pupils **shrink**, his body **trembles**.

Then—

**He bursts into tears.**

_"How can you be so cruel?!"_ he wails, clutching his face. _"I can’t even imagine how her family is feeling right now! Her mother… her father… her little fawn—oh, the tragedy!"_

He **grabs a chopstick**, clutching it **like a dagger**.

_"Just imagine, Gu Wang!"_ His voice **rises**. _"Imagine if you were the deer!"_

He **flips the chopstick** in his hand and suddenly **aims it at her throat**—

Gu Wang **jerks backward**, heart hammering.

Fang Yuan leans forward, **eyes glistening with madness**.

_"Let’s switch places! You be the innocent deer, and I’ll be the merciless hunter! I’ll wait until you return home, let you see your family, and then—"_

**SLAM!**

Gu Xianer **slams her hand onto the table**.

_"Brother, you are tired. Please eat."_

Silence.

Fang Yuan’s **tears instantly vanish**.

His expression **shifts completely**—

From **grief-stricken sorrow** to **gentle warmth**.

He blinks.

_"Sister…_" His voice is **soft, affectionate**. _"Have you helped prepare this?"_

Gu Xianer fidgets slightly, her face turning a little pink.

_"I… I was just standing there when they prepared the meat, but I helped chop the vegetables…"_

Fang Yuan’s **smile widens**.

_"Ahh, my cute sister’s first time preparing food for her brother…"_ He sighs dreamily. _"Just hearing that makes me hungry!"_

Gu Wang **stares in disbelief**.

Her **eye twitches violently**.

**What. The. Hell. Is. Wrong. With. Him?!**

One moment, he's **sobbing like a grieving widow**, the next, he's **beaming like a proud older brother**!

Fang Yuan picks up a piece of meat, examining it thoughtfully.

Then—

He suddenly **places his hand over his heart** and whispers, _"Ah… I see it now…"_

Gu Wang **grits her teeth**. _What now?!_

Fang Yuan lifts the piece of deer meat with the chopstick.

_"This deer… it is not just any deer."_

Everyone **holds their breath**.

Fang Yuan grins.

_"This deer is a **hero**."_

**Silence.**

Gu Wang’s **vein bulges**.

_"What the hell are you talking about?! It’s just a deer!"_

Fang Yuan gasps dramatically, clutching his chest.

_"Just a deer?! How can you say that?! This deer… it was **destined** to be eaten by me! It is its **pride** to be cooked by my little sister!"_

Gu Wang looks like she’s about to **flip the entire table**.

Gu Xianer quickly adds, "_I… I didn’t do much. Gu Wang prepared everything…_"

Silence.

Then—

Fang Yuan’s **eyes narrow mischievously**.

_"My cute little sister…_" he sighs dramatically.

Gu Xianer blinks, confused.

_"Have you forgotten?"_ Fang Yuan **closes his eyes, his voice weak**. _"I am very injured… my hand is broken…"_

Gu Wang's eyes **widen**.

Gu Xianer **freezes**.

For a moment—

She had **completely forgotten.**

Fang Yuan tilts his head, **smiling playfully**.

_"Now tell me, Sister…"_ He leans closer, voice as soft as silk.

_"Is it fair that I have been feeding you since our parents died?"_

Gu Xianer’s **heart pounds**.

_"Don’t you think… you should start feeding me too?"_

A deep, **determined** fire **flares up** in Gu Xianer’s eyes.

_"Yes, Brother! You are right!"_ she declares.

_"From now on, I will wake you up, make you fresh, wash your clothes, and even more—I will feed you every day, every meal!"_

Silence.

Wang Er and Old Man Wang **turn paler than corpses**.

Gu Wang **wants to smash the plate on Fang Yuan’s head**.

And Fang Yuan?

He just **smiles gently**, as if everything is perfectly normal.

_"Good girl."_

Gu Xianer **beams with happiness**.

Gu Wang **grits her teeth so hard she might crack them**.

**What the hell is wrong with this family?!**

---
After a few moments,

Gu Xianer’s tiny hands tremble as she picks up a piece of meat and carefully lifts it toward Fang Yuan’s mouth. She has never fed anyone before—no, she has barely learned how to eat by herself! Only a few weeks ago, she would have waited for Fang Yuan to feed her instead. Now, it is her turn. Her heart swells with determination.

But her hands shake. She miscalculates. The meat smears against Fang Yuan’s cheek instead of his lips.

"A-Ah! Brother! I’m sorry!" she gasps, her face turning pale as she hurriedly pulls back.

The room falls silent.

Fang Yuan freezes. His expression darkens. Slowly, he lifts a trembling hand to his cheek, touching the greasy smear. His breathing becomes heavy. His shoulders shake. His lips quiver. His eyes glisten as if holding back a storm of emotions.

Gu Xianer’s own eyes begin to tear up. "B-Brother… I—"

Fang Yuan abruptly clenches his fists. His voice trembles, filled with deep sorrow. "How could you…" His gaze locks onto Gu Xianer, shaking with heartbreak. "How could you do this to me…? My own flesh and blood… my own twin sister… treating me like this…" His voice cracks, and his body sways as if he is about to collapse from grief.

Gu Xianer panics. "No, no! Brother, I—!"

Suddenly—

"Hahahahaha!" Fang Yuan throws his head back, laughing wildly, his sorrow vanishing like smoke in the wind. "Hahaha! My sister! My artistic, brilliant sister! What a new and innovative way to feed someone! Who else would think of seasoning my face before letting me taste the food? A true genius! Perhaps next time, you should dunk my whole head in the stew before feeding me!"

Gu Wang, who has been watching this entire scene with increasing frustration, finally snaps. "WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!" she shouts, slamming her hands on the table.

Old Man Wang and Wang Er don’t even flinch. They can’t. They are frozen, paralyzed, pale as corpses. Every time they see Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer, their minds drag them back to that night—the pool of blood, the twisted bodies of the bandits writhing in agony, Gu Xianer’s bloodied, ruined form sobbing over Fang Yuan’s lifeless body. That night has branded itself into their very souls. Their hands tremble. Their breath is shallow. They don’t dare to move.

Gu Wang, however, has no fear—only frustration. "She’s trying her best, and you’re treating this like a joke!" she yells, glaring at Fang Yuan.

Fang Yuan’s expression changes again in an instant. His laughter dies. His eyes turn red, and his lips tremble. His entire body shakes.

"H-How cruel…" His voice breaks, real tears rolling down his face. "How heartless of you, Gu Wang… She’s trying so hard, and you scold ME? You don’t understand the bond between siblings! You don’t understand what it’s like!" His voice rises, passionate and full of tragic pain. "If I were a wounded little deer and Gu Xianer was the hunter, I would gladly let her butcher me! That is love! That is devotion!"

Gu Wang’s eye twitches violently. "WHAT KIND OF INSANE LOGIC IS THAT?!"

Old Man Wang and Wang Er break into a cold sweat.

Gu Xianer, completely missing the tension in the room, sniffles and wipes Fang Yuan’s tears away with her sleeve. "Brother, don’t be sad! I’ll feed you properly this time, I promise!" She picks up another piece and carefully places it into Fang Yuan’s mouth.

Chomp!

"Ah!" Gu Xianer yelps. Her eyes widen as she realizes—Fang Yuan has bitten down on her finger!

A chilling silence blankets the room.

Gu Wang leaps to her feet. "Oi! LET GO OF HER!"

Old Man Wang and Wang Er don’t even breathe.

Fang Yuan, still holding Gu Xianer’s finger in his mouth, slowly looks at Gu Wang. His eyes gleam with something unreadable, something dangerous.

Then, slowly, he releases the finger and licks his lips. His voice is soft, almost a whisper. "Mmm… flavored with the innocence of my dear sister. Delicious."

Gu Wang looks ready to murder him. "YOU—"

Gu Xianer, completely oblivious, sighs in relief. "Brother! You scared me! I thought you were really going to eat me!"

Fang Yuan tilts his head, smiling. "Who says I won’t? You do look quite tender, dear sister…"

Gu Wang lunges forward. "THAT’S IT, I’M—!"

Old Man Wang and Wang Er grab her with all their strength. They are shaking so badly that they nearly collapse.

Fang Yuan sighs dramatically and leans back. "Ah, but my little sister is too sweet to eat. I’ll settle for this deer instead. Gu Wang, come, feed me next."

Gu Wang’s face turns red with rage. "LIKE HELL I WILL!"

Fang Yuan bursts into laughter again, and Gu Xianer, as if nothing happened, happily picks up another piece of meat.
