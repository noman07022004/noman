The forest is a vast, endless shadow under the night sky. No moon shines above, and thick clouds hide the stars, covering the land in heavy darkness. The tall trees form a roof, blocking what little light remains. Even the wind blows softly, making the night feel strangely silent.

Old Man Wang moves carefully, his lantern casting a weak, flickering light on the twisted roots and wet ground. His son, Wang Er, follows closely behind, whispering nervously in the darkness.

"Father, don’t worry so much. Sister Wang is strong. She won’t be afraid. Nothing will happen to her."

Old Man Wang sighs and frowns. "I told you we set enough traps! But no, you insisted on covering the whole damn area. Now we are late. Look, it's already pitch dark. Do you know how dangerous it is at night? Anything can happen!"

Wang Er sighs but does not argue. Before they can continue speaking, a strong smell fills their noses. Metallic. Heavy. Overpowering.

"Blood," Old Man Wang mutters, his eyes narrowing. His years as a hunter tell him this isn’t animal blood—it’s human. And there is far too much of it. His body tenses as he signals Wang Er to be quiet.

They move forward using their silent hunting steps, blending into the night. The deeper they go, the stronger the smell becomes. The weak glow of the lantern barely lights their way, but their sharp eyes miss nothing.

Then, they see it.

Two men lie on the ground, twisting in pain. Their hands clutch their own throats, fingers digging into their skin as they roll back and forth, struggling for air. A simple rock—just a rock—has been thrown at them, yet their suffering is beyond words. Their faces twist in pain, their mouths open in silent screams as their bodies shake violently. Blood leaks through their fingers, soaking the ground beneath them. Their deaths are slow and painful.

Old Man Wang stops breathing for a moment. This isn’t a fight. This isn’t a hunt. This is pure, cold cruelty.

"Let’s leave," Wang Er whispers, his voice shaking.

Then, they hear it. A girl’s cry, filled with pain and desperation.

"Brother! Please! Don’t die! I’ll be good! I swear, I won’t cause trouble! Just come back! Please! If a life must be taken, take mine instead!"

The sadness in her voice is unbearable. Old Man Wang clenches his jaw, caught between fear and human kindness. Against every warning in his heart, he moves toward the cave. Wang Er follows, both gripping their weapons tightly.

The cave stands ahead. A flickering light dances on the walls, revealing a nightmare.

Men. Dozens of them.

Each one is in pain, their bodies shaking, their eyes bulging from their heads. Their mouths are wide open in silent screams, but no sound comes out—only pure suffering. The pain in the air is so strong that even Old Man Wang, a seasoned hunter, feels his legs shake. The ground is covered in blood, forming dark pools that shine under the dim light.

And in the center of it all sits a girl.

Gu Xianer.

Her clothes are torn, her body covered in blood. So much blood that her skin is no longer visible. It looks as if she has bathed in it, the red liquid sinking into her hair, her fingers, her very soul. The smell of iron is everywhere. The dim cave light makes her look less like a human and more like a demon from an old legend, born from blood and darkness.

Yet, despite everything, she holds a broken body in her lap.

Fang Yuan.

Old Man Wang and Wang Er freeze in horror as they look at him.

His body—if it can still be called that—is ruined beyond recognition. His bones stick out at unnatural angles, his arms and legs swollen and dark, his flesh torn and destroyed as if he was eaten and spat out by a monster. His skin is cracked, split open like broken porcelain, deep wounds leaking blood so dark it looks almost black. His fingers—shattered, bent, ruined—twitch weakly as if reaching for something that isn’t there. His ribs, or what remains of them, poke through torn flesh, dark blood oozing from wounds too deep to heal. His chest barely rises, each breath a battle against death itself.

Old Man Wang wants to turn away, but he cannot. He has seen many animals ripped apart by wild beasts, but this? This is something far worse.

Gu Xianer’s bloodshot eyes lock onto Old Man Wang and Wang Er. Her gaze is not human. It is wild, broken, filled with madness and sorrow. Her voice is a scream of desperation.

"Help him! Please! Save my brother! Take my life if you must—just save him!"

The words do not reach Old Man Wang right away. His mind refuses to accept them, frozen by the horror before him. His body does not move. He feels nothing—no pain, no breath, no thought. Only cold, empty fear. Wang Er stands beside him, frozen, his eyes wide with terror.

After long, painful seconds, Old Man Wang forces his body to move. His hands shake as he searches his pouch, pulling out what little medicine he has, but nothing works. It is as if Fang Yuan’s body has already started rejecting life itself.

"We... we need to take him back," Old Man Wang says, his voice dry. "We have medicine. Good medicine. There might be a chance..."

Gu Xianer does not hesitate. "Yes! Please, take him! I’ll do anything!"

With great effort, Old Man Wang and Wang Er lift Fang Yuan’s broken body, careful not to hurt him more. Even in unconsciousness, he barely reacts—his pain has long passed the limit of what a person can endure.

As they carry him out of the cave, Old Man Wang and Wang Er look back one last time at the nightmare behind them. The men who should have been long dead are still moving, their bodies trembling, their fingers clawing weakly at the blood-soaked ground. Their eyes, wide and unfocused, hold no life—only endless suffering. Their mouths gape open, but no sound comes out, as if even death refuses to grant them the mercy of silence. Their limbs jerk, stiff yet restless, like puppets with their strings half-cut, trapped in an endless torment.

The air is thick with the stench of blood and rot, a suffocating weight pressing down on his chest. His hunter’s instincts scream at him to run, to never look back, to forget this place and the horror it holds. Yet his eyes remain fixed on the scene, unable to look away from the calculated cruelty before him. This is no simple killing. This is something far worse—pain designed not just to end life but to stretch the suffering, to make dying slow, to make them feel every moment of their own destruction.

A shiver crawls up Old Man Wang’s spine, something colder than the night air sinking into his bones. He has seen death before, but this… this is something beyond human understanding. It is a cruelty that does not kill, yet does not let one live. A cruelty that twists life into a state worse than death.

And for the first time in their lives, he and Wang Er truly understand what cruelty and fear truly mean.

The night is thick with the scent of blood, the taste of iron lingering in the air like a curse that refuses to lift. The weight of Fang Yuan's ruined body presses down on Old Man Wang and Wang Er as they struggle through the uneven mountain path, their steps slow, deliberate, each one threatening to tip the fragile balance between life and death. His body is barely more than a broken husk, a vessel that should no longer hold life, and yet, somehow, he still breathes. Barely.

Gu Xianer stumbles beside them, her blood-soaked hands clutching at Fang Yuan’s shattered fingers as if by holding onto him, she can anchor his soul to this world. But the warmth of his skin is fading. His fingers are cold, unmoving, and with every step, she feels him slipping further away. Her breath comes in short, panicked gasps, her chest tight, her small frame trembling violently. The world around her is silent except for the sound of her own heartbeat crashing against her ears.

"Please... please don’t die. Please don’t die. It’s my fault... It’s all my fault..."

Her whispers are broken, each word barely forming in her mind before slipping out into the empty darkness. She cannot think—her brain refuses to piece together anything beyond the single, suffocating fact that she did this. It was her idea to leave the village. She was the one who insisted, even when Fang Yuan told her it was dangerous. She had laughed, pouted, whined until he gave in. And now...

A sharp sob escapes her lips. Her legs buckle, but she forces herself to keep moving, dragging her small, bloodstained body forward, her fingers tightening around his hand. Her mind is like that of a child, unable to process complex thoughts, unable to fully comprehend consequences, but the pain in her chest is real. The crushing weight of guilt is real. And the fear—the unbearable, suffocating fear—is real.

She has seen Fang Yuan fight before. He was always strong, always in control, always calm. Even when he bled, even when he was outnumbered, he never looked like this. Never so broken. Never so close to the abyss. And now, he is silent. So silent.

She lets out a wail, raw and full of despair. "Brother... brother... I'm sorry... I didn’t mean to... I didn’t mean for this to happen! Please! Please wake up!"

Old Man Wang and Wang Er exchange a glance, their grips tightening around Fang Yuan’s frail, bloodied body. The deeper they think about what they have witnessed, the colder their blood runs. This girl—this terrifying girl—must be an absolute monster. The bandits did something to Fang Yuan, something cruel beyond words, and she must have taken her revenge. Not with a quick death, not even with a slow death, but something far worse. Those men—they were still alive, still in agony, long after their fate was sealed. It was not mere slaughter. It was punishment.

And what kind of force could leave Fang Yuan in such a state? What had those bandits done? What kind of nightmarish cruelty had taken place in that cave?

The fear coils around them like a serpent, tightening its grip. They dare not voice it, but the thought is there—if they make one wrong move, if they say one wrong word, will they meet the same fate?

Wang Er swallows hard, unable to shake the image from his mind. The way the bandits had suffered, their bodies twitching in a torment beyond death, their screams still ringing in his ears. And then there was her—Gu Xianer, drenched in their blood, eyes hollow, hands trembling as she held onto Fang Yuan like a lifeline. A child’s mind trapped in a monster’s body. She had no thought to them, no care for anything but the brother in her arms. She had not even acknowledged the horror she had left behind.

Would she even hesitate if she thought they were a threat?

They walk for what feels like an eternity. The night grows colder, the mountain path steeper, and the weight of their burden heavier. The Wang family’s secluded house finally comes into view, its dim lantern glow flickering against the trees. Relief should wash over them, but it doesn’t. Because waiting at the door, bright-eyed and cheerful, is Gu Wang.

She is a stark contrast to the horrors they have just witnessed. She stands with her hands on her hips, her lips pursed in mock annoyance as she calls out, "You two sure took your time! Did you find anything—?"

The words die in her throat the moment she sees them.

Her father and brother, their clothes soaked in blood. The broken, mangled body in their arms, barely recognizable as human. And behind them—Gu Xianer.

Gu Wang’s eyes widen in horror. Gu Xianer, covered head to toe in crimson, her hair plastered to her face with drying blood, her eyes wide and empty like those of a soulless doll. She looks like something out of a nightmare, an ancient demon that has crawled out of the depths of hell, drenched in the blood of the damned.

Gu Wang stumbles back, her breath caught in her throat. "W-what... what happened?!"

Old Man Wang and Wang Er are trembling from fear. They can't understand what should they answer. They are fearful that if a single wrong words come out of their mouth, their whole family will go extinct and it won't be an easy death, maybe more painful that they have witnessed. They are even more fearful to look at Gu Xianer's eyes.

Gu Xianer does not look at her. She does not speak, does not acknowledge anything but the barely breathing Fang Yuan in their arms. Her lips tremble as she whimpers, over and over, the same broken words.

"Please... please don't die..."
