After some time, Fang Yuan steps out of his room, his presence cold and suffocating like an approaching storm. He moves swiftly toward the servants' quarters, his footsteps light but carrying an unseen weight that presses against the air itself.

When he arrives, he sees Old Man Wang and Wang Er trapped, surrounded by a pack of servants. The servants are toying with them, laughing, mocking—amused by their newfound playthings. They barely acknowledge Fang Yuan’s arrival, treating him as if he’s nothing more than another weakling, unworthy of their attention.

How foolish.

In that instant, Fang Yuan’s gentle expression vanishes. His soft eyes darken, turning into deep, endless abysses—pits of malice so pure they seem to devour all light. The room falls into silence. A heavy, unnatural stillness spreads as if time itself refuses to move under his gaze.

Then—like a lightning strike—he moves.

His hand lashes out, seizing a servant’s throat with a grip as unyielding as steel. The suddenness of it sends a shockwave of fear through the crowd. The servant gasps, his eyes bulging, hands clawing desperately at Fang Yuan’s fingers. But the more he struggles, the tighter the grip becomes, crushing his windpipe with slow, merciless pressure. His legs kick wildly, his body thrashes, but there is no escape.

Terror spreads like wildfire. The other servants stand frozen, their faces drained of color. They had mocked him, dismissed him as weak—but now, standing before them is something else entirely. Something far beyond their understanding. Just yesterday, Fang Yuan had seemed harmless, naive, barely worth a second glance. But now? Now, he is a force that suffocates the air itself, a presence so overwhelming that no one dares to even breathe too loudly.

Old Man Wang and Wang Er shake violently, their knees weak, their very souls on the verge of collapse. The other servants are no better. Their bodies are stiff, their hearts pounding like war drums inside their chests. But Fang Yuan does not loosen his grip.

The servant’s struggles weaken. His kicks slow. His fingers tremble, then fall limp. Finally, his body goes still, his consciousness—or perhaps his life—completely snuffed out.

Only then does Fang Yuan release him. With a flick of his wrist, he throws the limp body aside like a broken doll, letting it crash onto the ground without a second glance. And just as suddenly as the storm appeared, it vanishes.

A soft, innocent smile spreads across Fang Yuan’s face. His expression is warm, his voice gentle, like a loving friend greeting old companions.

“You’ve all taken such good care of the one I brought here,” he says softly, his tone light, almost affectionate. “I think each of you deserves a reward.”

The words drip with an eerie sweetness, yet they cut deeper than the sharpest blade. The servants, once so bold, now crumble like dry leaves. One by one, they fall to their knees, pressing their heads against the cold floor, their voices quivering as they beg for mercy.

Old Man Wang and Wang Er dare not move. They barely dare to exist. Even as Fang Yuan smiles, even as his voice remains kind, the horror in their hearts only grows. Because they understand—this is not kindness. This is something else entirely.

Then, Fang Yuan turns his gaze toward them. His dark eyes lock onto them, and their fear deepens. His voice remains impossibly soft, as if he’s speaking to children.

“You two may leave now,” he says gently. “But remember—check on Gu Wang every so often. When you return, ask any of these servants. They will make sure your daughter is notified. Now, go.”

There is no hesitation. No pause. Old Man Wang and Wang Er scramble away, their bodies shaking, their minds clouded with the lingering shadow of death that clings to every word Fang Yuan speaks.

Even his kindness is terrifying. Because behind that gentle smile lies something far worse than cruelty.

Fang Yuan strides into the clearing, his very presence twisting the air as if a storm were about to break. The atmosphere thickens, and the world seems to freeze. Then, like a bolt of lightning, he throws his arms wide and bellows with wild, unhinged glee:

"OH, MY LITTLE BROTHER! HOW ADORABLE YOU LOOK—SO INNOCENT, SO PURE! AND YET… SO VICIOUS! SO CRUEL! HAHAHAHA!"

Fang Zheng’s heart nearly stops. His mind reels—what? What?! WHAT?! A surge of terror crashes through him. Did Fang Yuan somehow learn his secret plans? Did he uncover everything? No—impossible! He forces himself to take a deep breath, struggling to think clearly. His frantic eyes lock onto Fang Yuan’s, and in that moment, relief nearly overwhelms him as he sees a bright, pure light shining like a divine halo.

For a fleeting second, Fang Zheng almost laughs in disbelief. No, Fang Yuan doesn’t know; he’s just being… bizarre. Bizarre, but not dangerous. Shaking off his nerves, Fang Zheng forces out a weak laugh and asks, "B-Brother, why are you calling me vicious and cruel?"

Then Fang Yuan’s entire demeanor shatters into theatrical pain. He gasps—a gasp so powerful it seems to shake the very earth—and clutches his chest as if an arrow of betrayal had struck his heart. His body trembles with raw devastation, and tears glisten in his eyes like dew on moonlit grass.

"YOU HAVE AN A-GRADE TALENT!" he cries out, voice ragged with despair. "AND WHAT DO I HAVE?! A D-GRADE TALENT! THE HEAVENS HAVE MOCKED ME! THEY'VE SPAT ON ME! AND YET… AND YET…"  
He collapses to his knees, shaking as if in disbelief. "MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD, MY BELOVED LITTLE BROTHER, YOU IGNORE ME IN MY DARKEST HOUR!"

Fang Zheng’s mind reels. His eye twitches—what. The. Hell? His mouth opens and closes as he desperately searches for a response.

"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!" he blurts, voice raw and trembling, as he tries to anchor himself back to reality. "I’M NOT IGNORING YOU!"

In an instant, Fang Yuan jerks upright as if struck by divine revelation. His face contorts into righteous fury, and he thrusts a trembling finger at Fang Zheng. Every muscle vibrates with a sense of deep betrayal.

"OH REALLY?! THEN WHY DO YOU LEAVE EVERY MORNING WITHOUT EVEN SAYING GOODBYE?! YOU RUN OFF TO 'SEE THE WILDERNESS' OR WHATEVER NONSENSE YOU’RE UP TO, AND YOU DON’T EVEN JOIN US FOR BREAKFAST!"

Fang Zheng stiffens, his thoughts scrambling in a whirlwind. His mind flashes to the Flower Wine Monk’s inheritance—of course, that must be it!

Struggling to regain control, Fang Zheng straightens his back and declares with as much conviction as he can muster, "I AM LEARNING NEW THINGS AND ADVENTURING INTO UNKNOWN REALMS! IT IS IMPORTANT WORK!"

Before he can catch his breath, Fang Yuan erupts into manic laughter. His head lurches back, his cackles echoing like mad thunder across the clearing. His entire body shakes with wild mirth—as if he has just heard the most outrageous joke ever told. Then, as quickly as the laughter rose, it dies away. Fang Yuan leans in close, his eyes burning with an unreadable fire, and his voice falls to a dangerous, hushed whisper:

"HOW ABOUT THIS, THEN… COMPENSATE ME WITH 1,000 PRIMEVAL STONES FOR ALL THE SUFFERING YOU’VE CAUSED ME."

Fang Zheng’s heart nearly stops.  
"WHAT?!" he gasps, voice barely audible, as his mind shatters into chaos.

Fang Yuan folds his arms and nods slowly, his grin widening unnervingly.  
"I KNOW YOU HAVE MANY PRIMEVAL STONES. 1,000 WON’T EVEN MAKE A DENT IN YOUR WEALTH, LITTLE BROTHER."

Fang Zheng’s thoughts spin out of control. Is he testing me? Is he probing my wealth? What kind of sick joke is this? Panic mixes with anger. He must not let Fang Yuan suspect anything; he must play the part of the poor, struggling brother.

Gritting his teeth until they ache, Fang Zheng forces his voice into a strained whimper:  
"HOW CAN I POSSIBLY HAVE THAT MANY?!"

Before he can speak another word, Fang Yuan tilts his head, and his expression softens—his voice turns gentle, almost too kind.  
"ARE YOU REALLY THAT POOR AND BROKEN, LITTLE BROTHER? THEN… HOW MUCH CAN YOU GIVE ME?"

Fang Zheng’s vision blurs; his mind collapses under the relentless barrage of shifting emotions. One moment, Fang Yuan is wailing in despair; the next, accusing him with fierce anger; then laughing like a madman—and now, he appears as a saint bestowing mercy. His brain, overwhelmed by the intensity, betrays him. In a frantic, confused rush, Fang Zheng blurts out the first number that comes to mind:

"H-HOW ABOUT One HUNDRED?!"

Fang Yuan’s eyes light up as if the very heavens have opened.  
"HAHAHA! PERFECT!" he roars, clapping his hands in delight. "GIVE ME THAT ONE HUNDRED! I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT BUYING SOMETHING FOR MY MAID AND XIAN’ER ANYWAY! EVEN 10 WOULD HAVE SUFFICED, BUT SINCE YOU OFFERED… HAHAHA!"

Before Fang Zheng can even protest, the pouch of primeval stones vanishes from his trembling hand. Fang Yuan spins on his heel and walks away, whistling a merry tune as if nothing extraordinary had happened.

Fang Zheng stands frozen, his soul shattered and his mind reeling. The entire encounter replays in his head like a relentless, torturous loop.  
What... what was that?!  
He feels as though his very identity is unravelling, his inner voice—a reincarnated author’s instinct—shouting in deafening silence:

"WHAT IS GOING ON?! EVEN YESTERDAY, HE WAS NAIVE, DULL, PALE, AND FULL OF SELF-PITY—BUT TODAY, HE IS UNRECOGNIZABLE! THIS IS NOT THE FANG YUAN I ONCE KNEW! NO… THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY!  
I KNOW HE DIDN’T USE SPRING AUTUMN CICADA TO MASK HIS TRUE SELF! MY INSTINCTS, MY AUTHOR’S INSTINCT—MY REINCARNATED SOUL—ARE SCREAMING AT ME! SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG!  
THIS DOESN’T FIT THE SCRIPT! I NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT’S GOING ON! QUICKLY!"

Fang Zheng grits his teeth, clenching his fists until his knuckles turn white. The world around him feels twisted and dangerous, as if reality itself has cracked open. And the worst part?  
He has no idea what is coming next.
