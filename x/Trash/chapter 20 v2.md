In the quiet morning light, the humble kitchen of the Wang family exudes a sense of warmth. The fire crackles softly in the stove, its gentle heat contrasting sharply with the cold, haunting memories still fresh in their minds. Gu Xianer and Gu Wang busily prepare breakfast, the aroma of freshly cooked rice mingling with the scent of herbs.

Gu Wang hums softly, breaking the heavy silence. "I think the porridge is ready. Should we take it to your brother now?"

Gu Xianer hesitates, her eyes clouded with uncertainty. "I... I don’t know when he’ll wake up. What if he doesn’t wake up at all? What if... he’s lost forever because of me?"

Gu Wang sets the pot down and places a comforting hand on Xianer’s shoulder. "You love him so much, don’t you? I can see it in your eyes, in your tears. Xianer, I don’t even want to recall the state he was in. Your brother... he almost sacrificed himself for you. That speaks volumes about his character. From everything I’ve seen, he’s an incredibly good man. He will come back, I’m sure of it. Don’t lose hope."

Her words carry a warmth that seeps into Xianer’s bones, but the younger girl’s lips tremble. "But... what if it’s not enough? What if I can’t bring him back? What if he resents me for dragging him into this?"

Gu Wang kneels to meet Xianer’s gaze. "He chose to protect you, Xianer. I don’t think someone who would go to such lengths for you could ever resent you. When he wakes up, show him how much you love him. That’s all you need to do."

Gu Xianer nods weakly, tears forming in her eyes. She allows Gu Wang’s encouragement to wash over her, giving her the strength to face the unknown.

They carry the breakfast to Fang Yuan’s room, setting it down on a small table near his bed. His body remains motionless, his face pale but peaceful. Xianer’s heart tightens at the sight, her fingers reaching out hesitantly to touch his cheek.

Her voice quivers. "Brother... please wake up. I’m so sorry. I need you. I can’t... I can’t do this without you."

Gu Wang places a comforting hand on her back. "He’s strong. He’s been fighting this entire time."

Desperation swells in Xianer’s chest. Suddenly, she remembers the method she used before. She leans forward, her forehead pressing gently against Fang Yuan’s, and begins channeling her primeval essence into him again, her tears trickling down her cheeks and onto his.

The room is quiet, the only sound the faint hum of Xianer’s essence flowing into him. Time drags on, and Xianer’s strength wanes. Her breaths grow shallow, her body swaying as exhaustion overtakes her. She slumps against Fang Yuan, her energy spent.

Gu Wang supports her, leading her to sit beside the bed. "Xianer, you’re pushing yourself too hard. He wouldn’t want you to hurt yourself like this."

Xianer’s voice cracks. "I just want him to open his eyes..."

Gu Wang wipes the tears from her face. "When he does, we’ll be here, okay? And when he wakes, you can show him the breakfast we made together. We’ll make him smile. He needs you, Xianer, just as much as you need him."

Xianer nods, finding comfort in Gu Wang’s presence. The two sit together, talking softly about their hopes and plans, creating a fragile peace amidst the tension.

Suddenly, a faint rustling draws their attention. Fang Yuan’s eyelids flutter open, the dark depths of his eyes slowly focusing. He takes in the sight of the two girls, their worried expressions, the remnants of tears on Xianer’s face.

Gu Xianer freezes, her heart pounding in her chest. Her mind struggles to comprehend the scene before her, and all she can manage is a stunned whisper, "Brother..." Her eyes are wide, the flood of emotions too overwhelming to contain.

Fang Yuan slowly sits up, his movements stiff, as though the weight of his past actions is finally lifting. The girls gasp in unison, unable to fathom the sudden shift in the atmosphere. Gu Xianer doesn’t wait—she rushes to him, throwing herself into his arms, her body shaking as her hands clutch at his shirt.

But before she can speak, before she can find the words, Fang Yuan's shoulders tremble with grief. Tears stream down his face, his sobs breaking the quiet. "I don’t deserve to be your brother," he chokes out, his voice thick with guilt. "I couldn’t protect you. You suffered so much because of me... You’re so young, yet you’ve endured too much. I should have been more careful, should have paid attention to time. If I hadn’t forgotten about it... you wouldn’t have suffered."

Gu Xianer can’t bear to see him like this. Her arms instinctively reach out, pulling him into an embrace. She presses her cheek to his chest, her tears soaking his shirt as she whispers fiercely, "Brother, it’s not your fault. It’s mine... I should’ve listened to you. I shouldn’t have gone out. I’ve been so selfish, and now you’ve suffered because of me. I swear, I’ll never be disobedient again. Please... don’t leave me. Please don’t ever leave me."

Fang Yuan holds her tighter, his breath ragged and uneven as his guilt floods him again. "I’m so sorry, Xianer. I’m so sorry you had to go through all this... because of me. I failed you."

They cry together, the silence of the room broken only by their shared grief. And then, as if something inside Fang Yuan snaps when his ear accidentally brushes against Gu Xianer's cheek, his sobs suddenly quiet down. For a split second, all the emotion drains from him, replaced by a sudden, almost childish curiosity.

Without warning, he starts rubbing his cheek against hers, a delighted grin spreading across his face. "Wow! Your cheeks are so soft!" he exclaims, his voice suddenly filled with childlike wonder. "This feels amazing!" He continues rubbing, his expression turning more gleeful by the second. "I’ve never felt anything like it! It’s like... like I’m in heaven!"

Gu Xianer, still processing everything, is caught off guard by the sudden change in his behavior. Her tears continue to fall, but now they mix with confusion and disbelief. She’s too overwhelmed to say anything, her face flushed with a strange mix of emotions.

Fang Yuan doesn’t seem to notice the confusion he’s causing. He moves from one cheek to the other, still rubbing his face against hers with bizarre enthusiasm. "I just need to rub my cheeks on yours, Xianer! It’s too good! I feel... I feel so peaceful!" he exclaims, his voice almost sing-song, filled with manic joy.

Gu Wang watches from a distance, her confusion palpable as she observes Fang Yuan’s odd behavior. Despite the chaos, she feels a flicker of relief. The suffocating sadness is beginning to dissipate, though she can’t quite understand what’s happening. Yet the laughter, the wildness in Fang Yuan’s actions, leaves her wondering just what kind of person he truly is.

Fang Yuan suddenly stops, pulling back with a grin that reaches his eyes. He cups Xianer’s face gently, his thumb tracing her cheek as he examines her closely. "You look so beautiful and cute," he says, his tone playful yet oddly tender. "Crying makes you even cuter. I’ve never seen anything more adorable than this."

Before she can react, Fang Yuan pinches her cheeks—hard. He laughs with abandon as he squeezes, his smile wide and satisfied. "Oh my god, they’re so squishy! So soft! I could pinch them forever!" His laughter grows louder, a wild, unhinged joy in his voice. "They’re so soft, Xianer. I really want to eat them. They’re just too cute!"

Gu Xianer, stunned, feels her emotions twist as the absurdity of the situation hits her. She can’t help but laugh, though her tears keep flowing, her emotions so tangled that she doesn’t know whether to cry or smile. "Brother... what are you doing?" she manages to ask between giggles, her voice full of disbelief and tenderness.

Inside Fang Yuan’s mind, a battle rages between his two selves. Unpredictable Fang Yuan shouts with excitement, "Quick! Capture this moment of my cute sister!"

Administrator Fang Yuan responds with a sharp reprimand, "Have you lost your mind? If you want, I can extract this moment from your memory later."

Unpredictable Fang Yuan laughs, unbothered. "I know you always read my mind, but you still ask me what I’m planning? Because it’s boring. Just capture the moment before I make you mad! Ha ha ha!"

Fang Yuan simply keeps squeezing Xianer’s cheeks, his satisfaction growing with each pinch. His laughter rings out as he continues his strange, unpredictable behavior, leaving Gu Xianer to laugh and cry in equal measure, her emotions completely out of her control.

Fang Yuan suddenly pauses, his grin faltering as a shadow of guilt crosses his face. "I’m such a bad brother," he murmurs, his voice faltering. "How could I let you... be touched by those filthy men? I don’t deserve you. I don’t deserve someone so pure, so good. I failed you, Xianer. I failed you all."

Xianer’s laughter falters, and she fights to suppress the wave of grief that surges within her. But she’s tired. Tired of the pain, the sorrow, and now... tired of being pulled in so many directions by Fang Yuan’s unpredictable moods. She looks at him, her face wet with tears but her heart filled with tenderness. "Brother... don’t say that," she whispers, her voice barely audible. "You’re the only brother I’ve ever had. I’m the one who’s not worthy of you. I should’ve listened to you. I caused all this pain."

Before she can finish, Fang Yuan erupts into a loud laugh, his hands still pinching her cheeks with wild enthusiasm. "Even though I’m a bad brother, I won’t let you go. I don’t care if you want to run away from me—I won’t let you leave. Ha ha ha!" He squeezes her cheeks again, his pressure affectionate yet overwhelming. "You’re mine, Xianer. I won't let you leave."

Gu Wang watches the two, unsure of what to make of the scene, but she can’t help the soft chuckle that escapes her lips. The tension that had clung to the room just moments before is gone, replaced by a strange sense of lightness. "I’m glad they’re together again. Even if it’s chaotic... at least they’ve found each other."

Meanwhile, in the hallway, Old Man Wang and Wang Er remain frozen, their eyes wide with terror and confusion. Their minds unearth grotesque memories—the blood pool in the dimly lit cave, Gu Xianer sitting motionless amid the carnage, her vacant eyes staring into the crimson abyss. Around her, the bandits writhe, their dying gasps weaving into a symphony of agony. The air had reeked of blood and something worse—something _unnatural_.

Now, watching her cry and laugh under Fang Yuan’s erratic grasp, a chilling thought slithers into their bones—what if this madness is only the beginning?

Wang Er’s voice quivers as he whispers, "Are all Gu Masters like this? Are they... are they this insane?"

Old Man Wang, though hardened by years of hunting and survival, feels his breath hitch. His hands tremble slightly as he recalls the massacre, the _deliberate_ cruelty behind every corpse. The way the bodies hadn’t simply died—they had _lingered_, as if the killer had wanted them to suffer, had _needed_ them to. Staring at the siblings—one weeping, the other lost in manic delight—he mutters under his breath, "Please, please just leave us be... If they lose control again... we won’t even have corpses left to bury."
