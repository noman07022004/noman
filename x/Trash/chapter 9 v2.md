Fang Zheng visits regularly now, always wearing a mask of concern, always pretending to care. Each time he sees Gu Xianer by Fang Yuan’s side, his words are carefully calculated, designed to break her spirit piece by piece.

"Xianer," he says softly, kneeling beside her. His eyes are full of false sympathy as he places a hand on her shoulder. "Do you think Fang Yuan would want to see you like this? Look at yourself—exhausted, pale, barely holding on. What would Brother feel if he woke up and saw you in this state?"

Gu Xianer’s tired eyes fill with tears, but she shakes her head, gripping Fang Yuan’s hand tightly. "No, I’m fine. Brother needs me. He’s always been there for me."

Fang Zheng lets out a long, dramatic sigh, his voice dropping to a tone of sorrow. "But have you thought about what it would mean to him? What if he wakes up and realizes you’ve sacrificed everything for him? That you haven’t advanced your rank because you’ve been here, worrying about him? He’ll blame himself, Xianer. Do you want him to wake up to that kind of guilt?"

Her grip on Fang Yuan’s hand falters for a moment, doubt flickering across her face. Fang Zheng sees it, and his smile deepens in his heart. He presses on, his words sharper now, cutting straight to the emotional core.

"What if he never wakes up? What if… this is his fate? You’re wasting your potential, Xianer. You were meant for greatness, but you’re tying yourself to someone who might never recover. He wouldn’t want this for you. You know that, don’t you?"

Gu Xianer bites her lip, her resolve cracking under the weight of his words. Tears stream down her face, and her shoulders tremble as she tries to hold onto her belief in her brother. "But… he’s my brother. I can’t just leave him…"

Fang Zheng crouches closer, his voice softening as he plays the role of a caring sibling. "I know, Xianer. I know how much you love him. But you’re not abandoning him—you’re honoring him by becoming stronger, by achieving what he would want for you."

As Gu Xianer grows more emotionally vulnerable, Fang Zheng begins to act even more manipulatively. He starts trying to fill the gap, mimicking Fang Yuan’s behavior to make himself seem like the supportive figure she needs. He offers to bring her meals, tries to feed her when she refuses to eat, and speaks in a tone that mirrors how Fang Yuan might have talked to her.

But Gu Xianer notices the difference. She feels the emptiness in his gestures, the lack of true warmth behind his actions. When Fang Zheng gently holds out a spoon, urging her to eat, she pushes his hand away. "No. Don’t… don’t act like him. You’re not Brother," she says, her voice breaking.

Fang Zheng masks his irritation with a sigh, shaking his head as if disappointed. "Xianer, you’re being unreasonable. I’m just trying to help. Brother would want you to take care of yourself."

Fang Zheng stands by Fang Yuan’s bedside, his gaze cold and calculating as he looks at his unconscious brother. His expression is one of feigned concern, but his thoughts twist with malice.

_"Just stay like this for a few more months, Fang Yuan,"_ he muses, his lips curling into a subtle, sinister smirk. _"Weak, helpless, and unable to do anything. Because once I reach rank 2, I will kill you with my own hands."_

His eyes narrow as his imagination runs wild, already envisioning the moment. _"And when you’re buried… that’s when the real fun begins. I’ll dig you up and refine your corpse into the Blood Derivation Gu Worm—my vital Gu Worm."_

A chuckle escapes his lips, low and chilling. _"Hehe… how fitting. You’ll finally be useful to me, even in death. Just wait, Brother. Your end will not only bring me satisfaction but pave the way for my rise."_

Fang Zheng glances at Gu Xianer, still sitting by Fang Yuan’s side, her tear-streaked face full of worry. His smirk fades, replaced by his practiced expression of concern. "Xianer, you’re too good to him," he says softly. But deep inside, his thoughts continue to churn, plotting the moment when Fang Yuan’s fate will be sealed for good.

Fang Zheng's gaze shifts to Gu Xianer, who sits by Fang Yuan’s side, her frail figure trembling as she clutches her brother's hand. His expression remains calm and caring, but his mind descends into dark, twisted thoughts.

_"Don’t worry, Gu Xianer,"_ he muses, his eyes scanning her tear-streaked face. _"Once Fang Yuan is out of the picture, you’ll have a new purpose. I’ll make sure of it."_

A sinister smirk tugs at the corners of his mouth, barely perceptible. "I’ll give you the real pleasure that Fang Yuan haven't failed to experience you. You’ll become my factory for bearing children with pure blood. He he he."

Fang Zheng glances at Fang Yuan’s unconscious body and then at the weary, broken Gu Xianer. His heart swells with dark satisfaction as he sees how perfectly everything is falling into place.

_"It looks like even the heavens are helping me,"_ he ponders, his smirk barely contained. _"Everything is aligning perfectly automatically, without a single mistake."_




















After a few weeks,
On a serene full moon night, Gu Xianer sits by Fang Yuan’s bedside, her delicate arms wrapped around him as if her warmth might bring him back. Her voice trembles, barely above a whisper, as she speaks to him.

"Brother, you once told me a story… about how even mortals could touch the moon," she says softly, her tears glistening in the moonlight. "You said it was a true story, from a place called Earth. You promised that one day, you'd tell me more stories like that. Brother… please, wake up."

Her voice breaks as tears stream down her face. She gently rests her forehead against his shoulder, repeating the story through sobs, clinging to the faint hope that her words might reach him.

Suddenly, Fang Yuan stirs, his body trembling as he draws in a shaky breath. His eyes slowly flutter open, and his gaze locks onto Gu Xianer’s tearful face. His voice, though hoarse, carries a hint of his usual teasing tone. "Gu Xianer… no more stories tonight. We need to rest. Tomorrow is the awakening ceremony."

Gu Xianer freezes, her tears momentarily stopping as shock overtakes her. "B-Brother?" she whispers, her voice cracking. But then joy floods her face, and she bursts into tears again, this time of relief and happiness. She hugs him tightly, sobbing into his chest. "Brother! You’re awake! You’re finally awake!"

Her cries echo through the house, drawing the attention of Fang Zheng, their aunt, and uncle. They rush into the room, their faces painted with expressions of surprise and supposed joy.

"You’re awake! This is wonderful!" their aunt exclaims, her voice filled with false cheer, though a flicker of anger lingers in her eyes.

"Fang Yuan, we were so worried," their uncle adds, his voice overly sweet, masking his displeasure. Fang Zheng, however, keeps his composure, forcing a smile as he steps closer. "Brother, I can’t believe it. You’ve finally come back to us."

Fang Yuan looks around, his face a mixture of confusion and weariness. "What… happened? Why are you all here? Did I… miss something?"

Gu Xianer clutches his hand tightly, her joy now mingled with worry. "Brother, don’t you remember? You’ve been unconscious for months…"

The room falls silent as Fang Yuan shakes his head slowly, his brows furrowing. "Months? No, I remember that tomorrow is the awakening ceremony."

The revelation shocks everyone. Fang Yuan has no memory of the events from the last few months. His mind is stuck in the past, as if the time since the ceremony never existed.

His aunt and uncle exchange quick glances, their smiles faltering for a moment. Inside, they seethe with frustration. "He’s awake? And he’s lost his memory? How inconvenient. Why couldn’t he have just stayed in that state or just died?"

Fang Zheng, too, is taken aback but quickly recovers, forcing a laugh. "Brother, you’ve been through a lot. It’s a miracle you’re awake. Don’t worry about what you’ve missed—we’ll help you." But inside, his thoughts are far darker.

Gu Xianer, oblivious to their true feelings, can’t stop smiling through her tears. She holds onto Fang Yuan as if afraid he’ll slip away again. "Brother, it doesn’t matter if you’ve forgotten. You’re back now. That’s all that matters."

Fang Yuan, still confused, glances at her and the others, sensing the strange tension in the room but too disoriented to question it. For now, he focuses on Gu Xianer’s smile, the only genuine warmth he feels amidst the web of deceit surrounding him.

As the joyous moment unfolds, Fang Yuan's body suddenly stiffens. His smile fades, and his eyes darken, as though an ominous shadow has crept into his mind. Without warning, Demonic Fang Yuan seizes control, and a chilling thought rises within him—a desire to kill Gu Xianer.

His hand begins to move toward her neck, trembling slightly, but as it inches closer, something inside resists. A force unlike anything Demonic Fang Yuan has encountered pushes back, halting his movement. Seeing this much resistance, Demonic Fang Yuan ponders, "This is interesting!"

In the next moment, Naive Fang Yuan regains control. His body jerks, his trembling hand dropping back to his side as though nothing had happened. But inside, his mind is in chaos. The thoughts of harming Gu Xianer echo in his head, and a wave of dread washes over him.

He looks at Gu Xianer, who gazes at him with confusion, completely unaware of the struggle he has just endured. "Brother?" she asks softly. "Are you okay? You look… strange. Did something happen?"

Fang Yuan’s breathing quickens, and his heart races. "No… it’s nothing," he mutters, but his voice is shaky. "What is wrong with me? Why did I suddenly lose control for a moment? Why would I even think something like that?"

Gu Xianer reaches out to him, her concern deepening. "Brother, are you sure you’re okay? You’ve been through so much. Please, tell me if something’s wrong."

Fang Yuan shakes his head, unable to meet her eyes. "I’m fine," he says again, though his voice is barely audible. The thoughts still linger in his mind, haunting him, leaving him to wrestle with a fear he can’t fully understand—fear of himself.

His uncle’s voice echoes through the room, loud and sharp, "Are you alright, Fang Yuan?"

The words seem distant, as though they come from another world. Fang Yuan turns to look at his uncle, his movements slow and mechanical. For a moment, their eyes meet. Then, Fang Yuan’s body freezes.

A sudden wave of fear washes over him, his chest tightening like a vice. His vision blurs as fragmented images flash through his mind—a memory, half-formed but vivid enough to make his knees buckle.

In the vision, his uncle stands before him, trembling with fear. "Fang Yuan… I’m your family," his uncle pleads, his voice shaking but carrying a desperate thread of hope. "How can you kill me?"

His uncle’s face is pale, his eyes wide with terror, but there’s something else—a faint glimmer of hope, clinging to the possibility that blood ties will save him. Yet, Fang Yuan sees himself in the vision, cold and unfeeling, his expression devoid of emotion.

Without a word, he raises his hand. The memory shifts violently as the younger version of himself strikes. Blood splatters. His uncle collapses, his hopeful gaze fading into lifeless emptiness. Fang Yuan sees himself standing over the body, his face untouched by remorse, his eyes filled with icy indifference.

The memory sends a jolt through him like lightning. Tears spill from his eyes, unbidden, streaming down his pale cheeks. His body begins to tremble uncontrollably.

"No… no… that’s not me…" he whispers, his voice trembling as his legs give way, forcing him to kneel. "Why… why would I…" His hands clutch at his chest, trying to ground himself, but the vision lingers, burning into his mind like a brand.

The room falls silent. His uncle looks at him, bewildered by Fang Yuan’s sudden reaction. "What’s wrong with him?" the uncle mutters under his breath, glancing around as if searching for an explanation.

Gu Xianer rushes to Fang Yuan’s side, her voice trembling with concern. "Brother, what happened? Why are you crying? Tell me!"

But Fang Yuan can’t answer. The vision has shattered something deep within him, leaving him drowning in fear, disbelief, and a suffocating sense of guilt. The memory feels real—too real—and the weight of it threatens to crush him. 

His aunt steps forward, her voice soft but tinged with concern. "Fang Yuan, are you alright? What’s wrong?"

Her question cuts through the haze of his swirling thoughts, and Fang Yuan instinctively looks at her. The moment their eyes meet, another vision bursts into his mind like a dam breaking, flooding him with memories he cannot escape.

This time, it is his aunt. She is on her knees, her face streaked with tears, her body trembling as she looks up at him. "Fang Yuan… why?" she sobs, her voice breaking with desperation. "Why did you kill him? He was your uncle—your family! Please… I beg you, spare me! Show some mercy!"

Her cries echo in his mind, raw and heart-wrenching, but in the vision, Fang Yuan doesn’t flinch. His expression remains cold, his eyes devoid of emotion. Without hesitation, he raises his hand. His aunt's cries grow louder, more frantic, as she tries to crawl away. But it is futile.

The Fang Yuan in the memory strikes. Blood pools around her as her body falls limp, her sobs silenced forever. In the vision, he stands over her lifeless form, completely unaffected, as if what he just did was no more significant than swatting a fly.

The vision snaps, yanking him back to the present. Fang Yuan stares at his aunt, his body trembling violently. Tears spill uncontrollably down his cheeks, his breaths shallow and erratic. His mind reels in disbelief.

Fang Yuan clutches his head and starts shouting, his voice echoing through the room, "This can’t be! This can’t be!" Tears pour down his face, his whole body trembling as he repeats the words over and over, his cries growing louder and more desperate.

Gu Xianer, kneeling beside him, is overcome with anxiety. Tears spill from her own eyes as she grips his arm tightly, her voice trembling as she pleads, "Brother, what’s wrong? Please, tell me! I’m here for you!" But her words seem to reach no part of him.

Fang Zheng stands at a distance, his brow furrowed as he observes the chaotic scene. He ponders silently, _What is wrong with him? Has he gone mad?_ Though his expression remains outwardly concerned, a flicker of annoyance passes through his eyes.

Uncle and Aunt exchange irritated glances. "What’s wrong with him now?" Uncle mutters under his breath, visibly displeased. Aunt huffs, her tone sharp. "Is he going mad? He’s causing such a scene!"

They try asking him what’s wrong, their voices laced with feigned concern, but Fang Yuan doesn’t respond. Instead, his cries grow louder, his shouts of "This can’t be!" ringing out like a plea to escape something unseen.

The commotion draws the attention of the household servants, who rush into the room to check what’s happening. The sight of Fang Yuan shouting, trembling, and crying leaves them stunned.

Suddenly, as if seeking refuge from his torment, Fang Yuan turns and throws his arms around Gu Xianer, holding her tightly as if she’s the only thing keeping him from falling apart. Tears stream down his face as he buries his head in her shoulder, sobbing uncontrollably.

Gu Xianer, equally shaken, embraces him just as tightly, her own tears falling as she whispers, "Brother, I’m here. Don’t be scared. I won’t leave you. I promise." Her voice trembles, but her resolve to comfort him doesn’t waver.

The room falls silent except for the sound of their sobs. Fang Yuan clings to her, his cries gradually softening as exhaustion takes over. His trembling body finally grows still, and his breathing steadies as he falls asleep in Gu Xianer’s lap, utterly spent.

Gu Xianer strokes his hair gently, her tears still falling. Her heart aches as she looks at his tear-streaked face, wondering what could have caused him such unbearable pain. Meanwhile, Uncle, Aunt, and Fang Zheng exchange annoyed glances, their expressions betraying their frustration with the scene.

Fang Zheng crosses his arms, a hint of malice flickering in his eyes as he thinks, _What a pitiful sight. But this might be useful later._

Despite the room being filled with people, the moment feels intensely personal between Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer. She sits silently, holding him close, determined to protect him no matter what, while the rest of the room watches with a mix of confusion, irritation, and hidden agendas.
