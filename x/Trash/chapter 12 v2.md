A few days later, the family gathers for dinner. The warm glow of the lanterns paints a serene picture, but beneath the surface, the air is fraught with an unspoken tension. Uncle begins the conversation, his voice warm and laced with pride.

“Fang Zheng, you’ve made us so proud,” he says, his smile wide and genuine as he addresses his nephew. “Breaking through to the rank 1 upper stage at such a young age… truly remarkable.”

He then turns to Gu Xianer, his tone softening with affection. “And you, Gu Xianer. Reaching the rank 1 middle stage is no small feat either. You’ve worked hard, and we’re proud of you.”

But when his gaze lands on Fang Yuan, the energy shifts. His smile grows tight, and his voice takes on a subtle note of condescension. “And Fang Yuan… you’ve worked hard too. Despite being a D-grade talent, you’ve managed to reach the rank 1 middle stage. Truly… admirable.”

Fang Yuan remains silent, his eyes fixed on the food in front of him, his expression unreadable. He offers a small nod of acknowledgment but says nothing.

Uncle clears his throat, the jovial tone returning to his voice. “Your aunt and I have been thinking about something for a long time now. We don’t have children of our own, but we’ve always seen the three of you as our family. So, we’ve decided… we want to officially adopt you.”

Aunty quickly adds, her voice trembling with emotion, “Yes, we’ve always thought of you as our children. But now, we want to make it official. We want to be your real parents.”

For a moment, there’s a heavy silence. Then Fang Zheng coughs awkwardly, his expression hesitant. “I… I also want to stay with you, Uncle, Aunt. But…”

Uncle’s smile falters, his brows furrowing. “But what, Fang Zheng? Speak your mind. Don’t hold back.”

Fang Zheng hesitates before finally responding, his voice filled with reluctant sincerity. “Actually, Chi Chen and I have become close friends. A few days ago, he invited me to his house. His grandfather was impressed with me and offered me 100 primeval stones. He said if I joined the Chi Faction, they’d give me a one-time bonus of 1,000 primeval stones and a weekly allowance of 50.”

The room grows colder as Fang Zheng continues, “And it’s not just them. Mo Bei also invited me over, and his grandfather offered 120 primeval stones. If I joined the Mo Faction, I’d receive a bonus of 1,200 primeval stones and 60 primeval stones weekly.”

Uncle and Aunt stiffen, their smiles fading into forced neutrality. Fang Zheng sighs deeply, his voice heavy with false regret. “I thought about it, Uncle, Aunt. If Gu Xianer and I joined either faction, we could instantly earn over 2,000 primeval stones. More importantly, we’d have a stable income of more than 100 primeval stones weekly. While we don’t need that much for ourselves, I thought… we could use it to support our big brother.”

He turns to Fang Yuan, his expression filled with feigned brotherly affection. “Brother, you’re a D-grade talent, and it’s harder for you to cultivate. I thought if Gu Xianer and I gave half of our income to you, it would help you overcome your lack of talent.”

With that, Fang Zheng takes out a small bag and places it in front of Fang Yuan. “Here, Brother. This is for you—70 primeval stones. Use it to further your cultivation.”

He turns to Gu Xianer, handing her another bag. “And for you, Xianer, 50 primeval stones. It should be helpful.”

Fang Yuan tries to refuse, his voice shaky. “I… I can’t take this.”

But Fang Zheng insists, his voice unwavering. “Brother, take it. You’ve always taken care of us since we were children. Now it’s our turn to look after you.”

Gu Xianer chimes in, her eyes shimmering with determination. “Yes, Brother. I want to be adopted by the Chi or Mo Faction. That way, I can help you more.”

Uncle’s face twists with anguish, his voice trembling as he speaks. “I… I can also give you a weekly allowance. It won’t be as much as the factions offer, but it will be enough for your cultivation. You don’t need to leave us for that.”

Suddenly, he slams his hands on the table, his voice breaking. “Do you think we’re not enough for you? That our love, our care, our sacrifices mean nothing?!” Tears start streaming down his face as he continues, his voice choked with emotion. “You’re not just children to us. You’re our _everything_. Without you, there’s no meaning to our lives. You’re tearing our hearts apart.”

Aunty bursts into tears, her cries echoing through the room. “When your parents died, we took you in. We gave you everything we had, even when we had nothing to give. And now… now you want to leave us?” She looks directly at Fang Yuan, her face wet with tears. “Do you think we kept you just to abandon you? You’re my child. _My child!_ And no one will take you away from me!”

Uncle collapses into his chair, his hands trembling. “The primeval stones we gave you each week… you see them as numbers, but they’re not. They’re filled with our love, our hopes, our dreams for you. Everything we have, we’ve saved for you. All our property, our wealth—it’s yours. Because we don’t have anyone else but you.”

Aunty suddenly lets out a heart-wrenching scream, her body shaking uncontrollably. “Who says I don’t have children?! You’re my children! And no one… NO ONE will take you away from me!” Her sobs grow louder as she trembles violently, and then, overwhelmed by emotion, she collapses onto the floor.

The room descends into chaos. Servants rush in, lifting Aunty’s limp body while Uncle clings to her hand, crying openly.

The dim lantern in Uncle and Aunt’s room flickers weakly, casting long shadows on their faces. The earlier show of emotional devastation at dinner is long gone, replaced by cold, calculating expressions. Uncle leans back in his chair, a cruel smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth.

“You surprised me tonight,” he says with a mocking chuckle, his eyes gleaming with approval. “I always thought you were nothing more than a brainless, pampered fool. But this? This performance… You outdid yourself.”

Aunt narrows her eyes, bristling slightly at the insult, but she lets it pass. There’s no room for pride here, only results. “What now? What’s the next step?” she asks, her voice soft but eager.

Uncle steeples his fingers, his tone calm and deliberate. “Now, you need to push the act even further. You’ll act like their decision to leave us has shattered your very soul. Play the frail, broken woman who can’t bear the thought of losing her children. Start fainting at the smallest mention of adoption. Cry at every opportunity. Make sure they see you as a pitiful, selfless mother who’s ready to sacrifice everything for them.”

Aunt nods thoughtfully. “And the household?”

“Start cutting back. Fire most of the servants in a week or so. Make it look like we’re struggling to keep them in comfort. No more extravagant meals or frivolous spending. As for you, drop the makeup entirely. Look tired. Haggard. Let them see the toll their decisions are taking on us. We’ll starve ourselves if we must—at least, that’s what they’ll believe.”

She smirks, catching on quickly. “You mean, we’ll make them feel like they’re bleeding us dry. But only because we _love_ them so much.”

“Exactly,” Uncle says, his grin widening. “I’ll give each of them 50 primeval stones every week. But—and this is key—you’ll weep every time we hand it over. Let them see the pain in your eyes, how much it ‘costs’ us to support them. And make sure to tell them it’s fine because ‘parents sacrifice for their children.’ Repeat it enough, and they’ll start to believe it.”

Aunt leans forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “And what about their inheritance? It’s too large to ignore.”

Uncle’s expression turns cold, his eyes glittering with greed. “That’s the whole point. By the time we’re done, they’ll be so indebted to us emotionally they won’t even think about their family inheritance. They’ll assume it’s ours, just like they’ll assume every sacrifice we’ve made is out of unconditional love. Do you realize how much we’re talking about here? One hundred thousand primeval stones. That’s what their parents left behind. And I’ll be damned if we let those brats take it away.”

Aunt smirks, already imagining the wealth. “And what about Fang Yuan? He’s harder to manipulate. Quiet, withdrawn… He doesn’t fall for things as easily as the other two.”

Uncle’s smirk deepens. “Fang Yuan is the linchpin. Gu Xianer and Fang Zheng adore him. If we control him, we control them. I’ll give him extra—20 more primeval stones weekly. We’ll frame it as us ‘going above and beyond’ to support him, despite his D-grade talent. We’ll make him feel like we’re pouring our hearts and souls into his future.”

Aunt raises an eyebrow. “And that’ll be enough? He’s sharp for his age.”

“Sharp, but broken,” Uncle replies, his tone laced with confidence. “He’s weak and desperate for approval. A child like that is easy to mold. We’ll play on his insecurities. Let him think we’re the only ones who believe in him, who care about him despite his flaws. He’ll feel so indebted to us that he’ll never question our intentions. And once we have him, Fang Zheng and Gu Xianer will be like puppets on strings.”

Aunt chuckles darkly. “I’ll make sure to ‘accidentally’ cry in front of Fang Yuan as often as possible. Let him see my suffering. Maybe even whisper something like, ‘I don’t mind starving as long as you’re happy.’ That should twist the knife in nicely.”

Uncle laughs, a cruel, satisfied sound. “Perfect. The more guilt he feels, the deeper our control will run. And when the time comes for them to graduate and take on clan missions, we’ll keep every ounce of their inheritance for ourselves. By then, they’ll thank us for it. They’ll see us as saints, sacrificing everything for their success.”

Aunt nods, her lips curling into a sinister smile. “By the time we’re done, they won’t just obey us—they’ll worship us.”

The room falls silent, save for the faint crackle of the lantern. Their schemes solidify in the dim light, every word dripping with calculated malice. The future, as far as they’re concerned, is theirs for the taking.

At the same time in Fang Zheng’s room, Fang Zheng is looking at the dark sky through windows standing before it. Today is the new moon night. Which makes it ghostly. Fang Zheng ponders while looking at the nonexistent moon, “Everything is going according to plan, but I haven’t expected my aunt and uncle to show me that much drama. They are thinking that I am in their hands, but in reality they are at paw. A few days ago, I manipulated Gu Yue Chi Chen and went to their house. Then, I talk alone with Chi Chen’s grandfather, Gu Yue Chi Lian. I told him that Chi Chen is only a C-grade talent, and you have faked it. He was thinking about killing me but couldn’t do it because of the circumstances. I took 1000 primeval stones from him, and I also told him that I am taking this as a tuition fee. I will teach Chi Chen, and we will become good brothers. So, he doesn’t need to worry.” 

Then Fang Zheng sits on the bed and continues to think, "Afterward, I manipulated Gu Yue Mo Bei, and as a result, I was also summoned by his grandfather. I told him that Gu Yue Chi Chen’s grandfather gave me 100 primeval stones, and we had a good lunch; he also told me that I and Chi Chen could be real brothers. Hearing this, he also gave me 120 primeval stones and then told me that his grandson could also become my brother. When I was talking with him, I told him that I heard a lot about his granddaughter. She is really brave and beautiful. I even mentioned that I would marry a brave girl like her. At that time, she came into the room, and I pretended that I fell in love with her at first glance. While talking, I gave many hints, like blashing just by hearing her voice—too embarrassed to look at her, etc. Afterward, her father went out, giving an excuse. We talked and walked with each other for some time, and I gave her a lot of hints, and she also gave me some indirect signals. Afterward, when I was leaving, Gu Yue Mo Chen, the grandfather of Gu Yue Mo Bei, behaved very gently. He he he. Everything is going according to plan.” 

Fang Zheng lays down on the bed and gives a satisfied smile and shouts in his heart with excitement, “I can’t stop but laugh, thinking about Yao Le, the successor of Medicine Hall. She is already dancing on my palm. Even though Fang Yuan is causing some problem when I manipulate Yao Le and Gu Xianer but everything is alright. 

Then, giving a devilish smile, Fang Zheng shouts in his heart, “Chi faction, Mo faction, and Medicine Hall are the three main factions in Gu Yue Village. Now they are in my paw. Even from now on, my big brother and my little sister will be indebted to me for the kindness that I have shown them today. They can never think what will be waiting for them in the future. For the time being, I will stay low while solidifying my strength. My next plan includes clan head Gu Yue Bo, my big brother Fang Yuan, my little sister Gu Xianer, merchant caravan owner Jia Fu, and his stupid brother Jia Jin Sheng. I have made a great plan for my big brother Fang Yuan and my cute little sister Gu Xianer. You two love each other so much. I will make you love practical. Ha ha ha. How good it would be to hear that the big brother, who loves his little sister very much, brutally raped her! I will execute this plan after buying some essential ingredients from the merchant caravan. He he he.” Fang Zheng’s sinister smile echos through the room, creating an eerie environment.

Hearing this eerie laughter, Shen Cui doesn't feel fear rather an unspoken joy as she prepare herself to serve Fang Zheng that she has earned from her pervious experience.
