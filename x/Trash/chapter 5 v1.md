The next day in the morning, Gu Xianer asks Fang Yuan with her cute face while holding Fang Yuan’s arms tightly, “Brother, today is holyday. Have you forgotten your promise?” 

Fang Yuan responds with confusion, “What promise? I can’t recall any promise that I have made to you.”

Making an angry face with an angry tone, Gu Xianer asks, “How can you forget it? You have promised me when I was a child.”

Fang Yuan responds with a panic, “Don’t be angry, my little princes. Please tell me what the promise is.”

Gu Xianer responds strongly, “You told me that we would visit the mountain when we would become a gu master. Can’t you recall? I want to wander around the mountain with you.”

Fang Yuan replies gently, “We are too weak now. And even more, we don’t have any offensive-type Gu. You have only a healing-type Gu and a defensive-type Gu, and I have only an investigation-type Gu and an escape-type Gu.”

Gu Xianer responds gently with a bright smile, “Brother, we are not going to fight anyone, and I don’t want to go to the forest in the mountain. We will follow the road, which is used by our clan. Even I have seen many residents of the village in the mountain come to our clan. They are not Gu masters. You can’t give me any lame excuse.”

Fang Yuan replies worrily, “Ok, I also know that, but it will be good if we take some powerful Gu master like Fang Zheng.”

Gu Xianer replies with annoyance, “No, I and you will go only. There is no danger. Even normal villager can go; why don’t we?”

Fang Yuan responds defeatedly and sighs, “Ok, we will go to the nearby village. If we encounter any danger, you have to run quickly without thinking about me. Do you understand?”

Gu Xianer responds, “Don’t worry. There would be no danger. Now, let's go.”

  

Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer are walking through the road that leads to the village. Fang Yuan tightly holds Gu Xianer’s hand. Gu Xianer excitedly shouts, "Look, brother! There is a small river flowing through the mountain. Look!Look! The mountain looks so beautiful with greenery trees. I have never gone out of our village. All looks very beautiful. Brother, have you ever been out of our village?”

  

Fang Yuan responds, “I haven’t ever gone out of our village in this life.” Gu Xianer holds Fang Yuan’s arm and asks confusingly, “What do you mean by that?” Fang Yuan responds while laughing, “It is nothing. You can say this was a dream.” Gu Xianer excitedly asks while they are walking along the road, “Then tell me about this dream.” Fang Yuan sighs deeply and says, “In my dream, I was the last normal human, and I died at the age of 30. Everyone was trying to save me, but there was no result.” Gu Xianer asks, “If you are the last human, then who will try to same you?” Fang Yuan responds, “You can think this way that for some reason all the mortals go extinct. You are the last mortal who is alive. What do you think all the immortals would do? They will try to stop the extinction. That had happened to me. The humans of earth were so evil and vicious that they had gone through a total of seven Great World Wars. A world war was daily routine, and humans were used to it. But the great world war wasn’t something that humans had anticipated. Look, we have reached our destination. Lets go.” Gu Xianer eagerly asks, “You haven’t even started telling about you.” 

Fang Yuan gently responds with a bright smile, “I will tell you later. It is a very sad and tragic story. Will you still like to hear it?”

Gu Xianer responds excitedly, “Yes, I will hear it. Look, brother, I think we are not in a village but in a village market.”

Fang Yuan says, “This is good. Now let's go and eat something from this market and buy something for you.”

Then Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer buy many things for each other. They eat many kinds of village food. Sometimes Fang Yuan feeds Gu Xianer; sometimes Gu Xianer feeds Fang Yuan. They enjoyed all day together.

Fang Yuan declares, “We went out in the morning; now it is already afternoon. Everyone would be worried. And it is not safe to stay outside after evening.”

  

Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer start returning to their village while the sun is setting behind them. While they are passing a narrow passage through the mountain, five men emerge from the rocks like predators looking at their prey. Their eyes gleam with cruelty, and their wicked smiles turn into something worse when they see Gu Xianer. One of them shouts with a vicious smile, “It looks like today’s night would be enjoyable for us.” 

They start commenting and talking with a vicious and wicked smile. “Hey girl, don’t worry. We will take good care of you.” “We will give you so much pleasure that you will remember it for ever. Ha ha ha.” “What should we do with the boy?” "Stop wasting your time. Just kill him and take the girl.” “No, it won’t be enjoyable if we do that. How about we enjoy his sister before his eyes?" “That is good. We shouldn’t be cruel. We should at least let him enjoy her sister with us. Ha ha ha.”

  

Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer are standing back to back in the middle, where they are surrounded from all directions. Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer tremble with fear while holding sticks in their hands. Fang Yuan shouts while his voice is trembling with fear, “Don’t come any closer. We have more than 100 primeval stones. We will give it all to you. Let us go.”

  

One of the attackers shouts, “Oh! You are gu masters. And you have more than 100 primeval stones. It looks like we have caught a big fish today.” Other shouts, “It would be even more enjoyable.” Everyone starts laughing viciously and commenting, How would they enjoy her?

  

Xu Xianer starts crying loudly and shouts, “It is all my fault. I should have listened to you.” Fang Yuan shouts, “How about it? You let Gu Xianer go, and I will stay as your hostage, and our clan would fulfill all your requirements.” While crying loudly, Fang Yuan shouts, “Just let her go; do whatever you want with me. Take all the primeval stones and Gu that we have. Just let her go!”

  

The leader of the attackers shouts, “They have more than 100 primeval stones, which means they could fight for a long time. They must have a profound background, which means they have many strong and powerful Gu worms. So, we all will attack at the same time from all directions. Otherwise, something may go wrong.”

  

They start shooting their attack from all directions. Seeing that, Gu Xianer tires to shield her brother. But even before she can shield him, Fang Yuan grabs Gu Xianer and then lays on the ground. Fang Yuan lays on Gu Xianer and uses his body as a shield and his two hands to cover her head so that she doesn’t get injured. One by one attacks start hitting Fang Yuan, which causes him intense pain, and he can’t take it anymore and faints on the spot. Even after fainting, he continues to grab Gu Xianer tightly. Gu Xianer was crying loudly a moment before, but now she can’t even say a single thing, and her eyes are wide open. Even though tears are falling like streams from her eyes, there is no sound in her crying.

  

The attackers pause their attack for a moment to check the result of their attacks. Even they become stupified after seeing the lifeless body of Fang Yuan, who was desperately saving his sister using his body without even using any Gu worm. His body condition was so bad and horrifying that even for a moment they got scared. The most deadly injury is in the head that causes his skull to turn apart, and the brain could be seen. Even in his chest, his internal organs are popping out. The skeleton of his body is visible in many areas, which makes it even more horrifying. Gu Xianer desperately uses her healing Gu worm, which somehow restores the major injuries and stops blood from coming out of his body.

  

The attackers are observing without interrupting them, and then someone shouts, “The boy is dead; now let’s take the girl and enjoy her to our hearts content.” Then one of them grabs Gu Xianer’s hand while Gu Xianer isn’t even looking at them. She is desperately using her healing gu worm. Suddenly someone hits at her neck, which causes her to lose consciousness. They take Gu Xianer at their shoulder, and she is hanging like a lifeless corpse. They enter deep into the mountain. The sun has already set, and the mountain looks dark and eerie while a lifeless corpse is lying on the ground.
