The Next Day in Gu Yue Village,

Gu Xianer is under the treatment of the medicine hall leader and her successor, Yao Le. After coming back, the clan leader announces a court meeting to decide Fang Yuan’s fate for endangering Gu Xianer. Everyone is mocking, cruising, and insulting Fang Yuan because he looks totally healthy and Gu Xianer looks skinny. Even Fang Zheng is confused. Everyone is talking among themselves. “It looks like someone has sucked Gu Xianer’s all vitality.” Hearing all of this, Fang Yuan doesn’t respond or show any emotions, but tears can be seen gathering in the corner of his eyes, but there is satisfaction in his face. 

In Fang Yuan’s mind, Administrator Fang Yuan shouts, “It looks like the unpredictable Fang Yuan is leaning more towards innocent Fang Yuan. It is unpredictable because sometimes it will lean more towards demonic Fang Yuan and sometimes it will lean more towards innocent Fang Yuan. According to logic, he should lean more towards demonic personality to face this situation, but it is leaning towards innocent Fang Yuan. Ha ha ha. It is really unpredictable. Don’t you think this is more interesting?”

Demonic Fang Yuan doesn’t respond and shows indifference as always.

After some discussion, the clan head announces that Fang Yuan will be under his eyes for two months in his mention. He will teach and punish Fang Yuan at the same time so that he doesn’t become a hindrance in the future for his siblings, who are the hope for the clan. Every faction leader agrees because they can’t give severe punishment to Fang Yuan, as he is loved by his siblings very much, and Gu Xianer and Fang Zheng are the hope and future of their clan.

  

In clan head’s mansion,

The clan head is confused as well as frightened about Fang Yuan’s master. He is a cunning person. He ponders while strolling, “It looks like the master of Fang Yuan wants to make Fang Yuan hate this village. He even orders not to tell the villager about Fang Yuan’s sacrifice and love for his sister. As a result, everyone was mocking and cursing Fang Yuan, and I have seen tears as well as satisfaction in his eyes, which means he is really after saving his sister as well as blaming himself for endangering his sister. If it continues, he will gather much hatred for his clanmen and will not feel any connection with them. That means his master wants to train Fang Yuan while at the same time making him feel lonely, helpless, and hatred towards his clanmen and close ones, and his method is not gentle either. That means his master must be a demonic cultivator or maybe a demonic Gu immortal, as he called me a lowly mortal. The chances of Fang Yuan’s master being immortal are low but not entirely zero." Without his knowing, he starts shaking from fear. Then he goes towards Fang Yuan’s room.

  

At Fang Yuan’s room in the clan head’s mansion,

Fang Yuan’s eyes look innocent but not entirely. He is reading about the legend of Ren Zu. Suddenly, the clan head enters this room. Fang Yuan shows respect to the clan head. Fang Yuan and the clan head are discussing the legend of Ren Zu. While teaching Fang Yuan about the legend of Ren Zu, the clan head ponders, “His eye looks innocent, but not that much from before, which means his master is trying to remove his innocence.” Thinking that, he shakes from fear without his knowing. Suddenly, Fang Yuan’s eyes turn into an eye of an endless abyss of darkness. Seeing this sudden change, Gu Yue Bo quickly jumps from his seat and activates his defensive Gu. 

Demonic Fang Yuan says, “Don’t be afraid. I will not harm you, as you have completed your task properly. Take this gu recipe as a reward, which I have created specially for your work. This gu will suit you.” After taking a look at the Gu recipe, the clan leader thanks Demonic Fang Yuan. Suddenly, with an authoritative tone, Demonic Fang Yuan orders, “I will give you a mission, you lowly mortal. If you could complete this mission, I will give you an opportunity to advance to rank 5, and there would be a clue about rank 6.” 

With a doubtful gaze, the clan leader looks at Fang Yuan, whose eye’s are like an endless dark abyss. He feels like Fang Yuan’s gaze could tear him apart, and he is completely naked before Fang Yuan.

Seeing a doubtful gaze, Fang Yuan asks, "You lowly mortal, let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a boy who was born in a mortal village. He was living a happy life with his parents. But one day, many wild beasts attacked the village. The villagers were not prepared. Everyone died. Even his parents got serious injuries while saving him. When they were about to die, someone came and killed all the wild beasts. This man tried to use many healing methods to save the boy’s parents, but it was too late. Before dying, they begged this immortal to save their child. The boy became his successor. Afterward, everything was going well. The boy became even more powerful than his master. His master and his master were both happy. What do you think about this story?”

The clan leader responds, “It means the immortals take their successor from the mortal world. I have also heard about this kind of story when I was young, and I even believed them, but as I grow up, I don’t believe them anymore. It looks like they are real. It may be possible that this is the story of you and your master.”

Fang Yuan responds with indifference, “You are right. It was me. But this is not the full story. Can you guess the full story?”  
The clan leader responds with confidence, “Your master may have died, and you have also become old, so you are looking for a successor.”

Fang Yuan adds, “You are right. But let me finish the full story. After I become powerful, I learn many immortal methods. After using some method while I was looking at my past, I found out that the wild beast attack was prepared by my master. At last he pretends to save me because he chose me as his successor, and I become very loyal and indebted to him.” Then, with a devilish smile, Fang Yuan asks, “What do you think of what I have done to my master?”

Hearing this, the clan head becomes very fearful. He has quite experience. Only by hearing this does he understand that before taking Fang Yuan away, he wants to make Fang Yuan’s clan powerful. When he thinks about what may have happened to the master, he starts shacking without knowing. It is as if he will die if he takes even a single wrong step. It means he is giving me opportunities as well as a strong warning.

Fang Yuan gives a gentle smile with his dark eye, which makes the clan head very frightened. Fang Yuan adds, “Go and bring all of these materials within one hour. All of those items are available in your clan. And asks all Gu Masters who are proficient at refining Gu warm to refine this gu warm. I want at least 100 within the next day."

The clan leader responds while shaking, “Yes, esteemed immortal, I will do as you have said.”

Then Fang Yuan gives a long list of gu materials that are available around the village and asks the clan leader, “Arrange them within two days and bring all of them to me. And also bring at least 100,000 spiritual stones with those materials.”

  

After Two Days

The clan leader offers Fang Yuan that he has listed. Fang Yuan checks and finds out that everything is right. The clan leader asks gently, “Esteemed immortal, what is the name of this gu worm?" You have ordered up to create more than one hundrad.” Fang Yuan responds, “I haven’t given any name for this gu worm. And the name is also not important. The work is important. This gu will allow me to temporarily control other people’s bodies to refine gu, and the more fascinating part is that it will not consume any primeval essence but rather it will consume itself gradually. So I have told you to create this gu worm so much as I don’t have enough primeval essence to activate this gu for one time.”

The clan leader becomes stupified because he has never seen this kind of gu. Before the clan leader can ask anything, Fang Yuan orders, “Now prepare yourself. Put all the primeval stones here and all the materials here.” There are piles of materials and primeval stones. Even before the clan leader could understand anything, Fang Yuan uses his brute force to sit her down and then tell him, “You are going to refine gu, and I will use this gu to control your refinement process. You can say that you are just a vessel that I am using to refine gu worms.” 

Fang Yuan sits behind the clan leader, places his hand on the clan leader’s back, and closes his eyes and then orders, “Let me control your body. Don’t put any kind of resistance.” With some doubts, the clan leader relaxes his body and puts off every resistance. Suddenly, he feels like he is no more; he has no body. He is just a will who is observing. Even if he tries to do anything, he can’t do it. He feels horrified. Fang Yuan starts refining gu worm using the clan leader’s body. After some time, he starts consuming primeval stones like a hungry beast. After some time, Fang Yuan completes refining several gu worms. Even before clan leader can understand anything, Fang Yuan uses several gu on clan leader. Clan leader feels like he is going to die. After 10 minutes, Gu Yue Bo becomes astonished that his cultivation is increasing rapidly. He starts breaking through his cultivation realms from rank four middle state to rank four upper stage, then rank four peak stage. And when it is the next day morning, he becomes rank 5 initial stage. Even before, Gu Yue Bo can enjoy. Fang Yuan starts refining Gu worms. He refines Gu worms from morning to night. At late night, Fang Yuan stops refining Gu and also removes his contron from Gu Yue Bo’s body. After taking control of his body, he feels intense joy but suddenly feels an intense headache, and also his whole body feels intense pain. He starts rolling on the ground in severe pain. He wants to cry loudly, but no sound comes out from intense pain. Suddenly, he faints on the spot.
