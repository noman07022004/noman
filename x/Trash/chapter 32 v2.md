After what feels like an eternity, they finally step into the village.

Gu Wang looks around, her eyes wide with wonder. Everything here feels alien—the houses, the shops, even the market stalls are constructed in ways she’s never seen before. Compared to her own village, this place is vast, bustling with life, almost as if it belongs to another realm entirely. The air hums with energy, and the people move with purpose, their faces painted with expressions of familiarity and routine. To Gu Wang, it feels overwhelming—like stepping into a dream where nothing makes sense but everything demands attention.

Beside her, Old Man Wang and Wang Er trudge along silently, their faces masks of exhaustion and dread. They don’t share her awe; instead, their eyes are hollow, haunted by the horrors they’ve witnessed over the past day. For them, there’s no room left for surprise. Every twist, every turn has become another layer of madness piled atop the last. Their steps are heavy, weighed down not just by fatigue but by the unspoken fear that lingers between them—a fear of what Fang Yuan might do next.

Suddenly, a figure bursts into view, sprinting toward them with desperate speed.

“**Young Master!** ” A servant shouts, his voice cracking under the strain of urgency and disbelief. “**Young Master Fang Yuan—is it really you?!** ”

Fang Yuan doesn’t slow. Not even for a heartbeat. With Gu Xianer cradled gently on his back, he adjusts her weight slightly and responds in a tone so casual it borders on dismissive. “Yes, it’s me. Keep your voice down—Xianer is sleeping.”

But the servant can’t contain himself. His eyes widen further, tears threatening to spill as relief and frustration collide within him. “Do you have any idea how worried everyone has been?! We’ve been searching for you without rest since yesterday!”

Fang Yuan waves a hand lazily, brushing off the man’s words as though they’re nothing more than dust on his sleeve. “Mm, that must’ve been tiring. Good job.”

The servant stares at him, mouth agape, utterly baffled by the nonchalance. Before he can process whether to press further or retreat, Fang Yuan’s gaze flickers toward him. It’s brief, fleeting—but enough.

“Follow quietly,” Fang Yuan says, his voice low, smooth, yet carrying an edge that cuts through the air like a blade.

The servant freezes. A cold shiver runs down his spine, rooting him to the spot. There’s something in Fang Yuan’s voice—an authority so absolute, so chilling, that it silences every thought in his head. It isn’t anger or malice—it’s worse. It’s indifference. As if the mere act of questioning Fang Yuan would render him irrelevant, unworthy of acknowledgment. The servant swallows hard, nods frantically, and steps back, retreating into the shadows without another word.

They continue walking.

Just a few paces later, another servant spots them. Recognition flashes across his face, followed swiftly by shock. His lips part, ready to shout—

But Fang Yuan’s gaze snaps to him like a whip cracking through the air.

“Shut your mouth,” Fang Yuan commands, his voice soft yet razor-sharp, slicing through the tension like a knife.

The servant freezes mid-breath, his body locking up as if struck by lightning. His knees wobble, threatening to give way beneath him. For a moment, time seems to stop. Fang Yuan’s eyes bore into him—dark, endless pits that seem to swallow light itself. There’s something lurking behind those irises, something ancient and monstrous, coiled tightly like a predator waiting to strike. It’s not human. Whatever it is, it watches, waits, judges—and hungers.

The servant’s instincts scream at him: **Make a sound, and you will die.**

He jerks his head down in a frantic nod, stumbling backward until he’s out of sight, his face pale as death itself.

Fang Yuan smirks faintly, the corner of his lips curling upward in satisfaction. Without missing a beat, he resumes walking, his pace steady, unhurried, as though nothing happened.

A few moments later, they arrive at their destination—their home.

---

By the time Fang Yuan steps into the house, carrying Gu Xianer soundly asleep on his back, the tension in the air crackles like lightning before a storm. Every breath feels heavier, every movement charged with unspoken danger.

His aunt’s face contorts the instant her eyes land on him. Fury ignites within her, blazing like wildfire as her hands clench into fists so tight that her knuckles turn white.  
“**Fang Yuan!** ” she snaps, her voice slicing through the room like a blade. “You’re completely fine?! Not a scratch?! And yet you had us all worried sick all night?!”

Her rage escalates when her gaze shifts to the strangers trailing behind him—Gu Wang, Wang Er, and Old Man Wang. Her expression darkens further, her lips curling into a snarl.  
“And who are **they** ?! Where in the world were you last night?!”

Before Fang Yuan can respond, hurried footsteps thunder down the hallway.  
“I heard Fang Yuan is back!”

Fang Zheng bursts into the room, his eyes wild with urgency. His gaze locks onto his older brother, taking in the scene—the sleeping Gu Xianer cradled protectively on Fang Yuan’s back, the three unfamiliar figures standing awkwardly behind him, and the way Fang Yuan carries himself with an infuriating calmness, as if nothing in this world could ever touch him.

Confusion flashes across Fang Zheng’s face, quickly replaced by suspicion.  
“What happened?” His voice is sharp, tense, laced with barely contained anger. “Where were you?”

Fang Yuan exhales lightly, almost dismissively, as though their questions bore him. Then, a slow, amused smile spreads across his face—a smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. There’s something unsettling about it, something predatory lurking beneath the surface.

“Oh?” he drawls, his tone deceptively casual, yet dripping with menace. “So many questions.” He shifts Gu Xianer slightly on his back, adjusting her weight with practiced ease, before gesturing lazily toward the group.  
“Well, since you’re all so curious…” His golden eyes gleam with mischief, his voice smooth as silk but edged with steel. “Xianer and I simply went to see how normal villagers live. You know, experiencing life outside these walls.”

His words hang in the air, light and nonchalant, as if he’s discussing the weather or some trivial errand. But there’s a weight behind them, a challenge hidden beneath the veneer of indifference.

“At a village market,” he continues, his tone almost nostalgic, “we were having a lovely time. And then—ah! Fate itself intervened.” A teasing grin tugs at his lips as his gaze lands on Gu Wang. “I happened to spot **her** selling hunting meat.”

He turns fully toward Gu Wang now, his golden eyes glinting with amusement—and something darker, more calculating.  
“Look at her—adorable, isn’t she? Beautiful, too.” His voice is soft, almost affectionate, but there’s an undertone of mockery, a cruel edge that makes her skin crawl.

Gu Wang stiffens under his intense scrutiny, her heartbeat quickening. Her cheeks flush at his words—**beautiful, adorable** —but it’s not flattery. It’s a game, one she doesn’t understand the rules of. The way he says it, the way his eyes gleam with unreadable intent, sends a shiver racing down her spine.

Fang Yuan chuckles softly, clearly entertained by his own thoughts.  
“Not only would I get to keep her,” he muses aloud, his voice carrying a dangerous sweetness, “but Xianer would gain a new playmate. Two birds with one stone, don’t you think?”

His aunt’s eyes widen in disbelief, her jaw tightening as fury bubbles beneath her skin. “You—!”

But Fang Yuan cuts her off effortlessly, his voice flowing smoothly over her protest like water over stone.  
“So, naturally, I followed her home. Met her father and brother. Had a pleasant little chat.” His lips curve into a faint, chilling smile. “**And wouldn’t you know it? They agreed.** ”

The temperature in the room plummets.

His voice drops lower, softer, yet infinitely more menacing. His gaze slides to Wang Er and Old Man Wang, pinning them in place with an unspoken threat. His smile remains gentle, almost affectionate—but it’s the kind of gentleness a predator shows its prey moments before striking.  
“Isn’t that right?”

The air grows suffocating, thick with an invisible pressure that presses against their chests, making it hard to breathe. Like unseen claws dragging across their skin, leaving trails of ice in their wake.

Old Man Wang’s fingers tremble violently. Wang Er’s breathing becomes shallow, erratic. Their minds scream the same warning:  
**Say the wrong thing, and you die.**

“Yes,” they whisper in unison, their voices trembling, barely audible.

Fang Yuan’s smile widens, satisfied, as if rewarding obedient pets.  
“Good.” His tone is light, playful even, but the underlying current of authority is undeniable.

His aunt looks ready to explode, her face flushed with rage. Fang Zheng’s knuckles turn white from how tightly he clenches his fists, his body coiled like a spring, ready to strike. The servants shift uncomfortably, exchanging uneasy glances.

They had imagined the worst—a kidnapping, an attack, something terrifying. And yet… **this** was his explanation?

Rage simmers just below the surface, threatening to boil over. His aunt opens her mouth, ready to unleash her fury—

But Fang Yuan moves first.

“Xianer worked hard,” he says lazily, shifting her slightly on his back. For the briefest moment, his expression softens, the barest flicker of warmth lighting up his eyes as he glances at her peaceful, sleeping face. “She’s tired. I’m taking her to my room so she can rest.”

The moment he speaks, it is final.

Without waiting for a response, he turns and walks away, his footsteps calm, unhurried, absolute.

As he passes Gu Wang, he tilts his head slightly, his golden eyes locking onto hers. His voice is low, almost intimate, yet carrying an unmistakable command.  
“Follow me.”

Gu Wang freezes, her heart pounding in her chest. The weight of every furious, suspicious gaze in the room crashes down on her, suffocating. The scrutiny. The silent demand for answers. It’s overwhelming.

Her hands feel cold. Her legs feel weak.

But the moment Fang Yuan speaks, the storm vanishes.

Warmth seeps through her chest, unexpected and inexplicable. Safe. She feels **safe** , as if stepping out of the freezing cold and into a warm embrace.

Before she even realizes it, **she follows.**

Wang Er and Old Man Wang remain behind, stiff as statues, until Fang Yuan’s voice drifts back, soft yet carrying an unmistakable weight.  
“Talk to them.”

They flinch, their bodies jerking involuntarily. There is no hesitation. No second thought. They bow their heads, ready to obey.

And as Gu Wang trails behind Fang Yuan, unknowingly, a small, helpless smile tugs at her lips.

She doesn’t even know why.

But for the first time, she feels like she belongs somewhere.

---

As Fang Yuan disappears into his room with Gu Xianer and Gu Wang, a suffocating pressure settles over the hall. It is the calm before the storm.

Then—**BANG!**

His aunt **slams her fist against the table**, the entire room seeming to shake with her fury. The wood groans under the force, but it is nothing compared to the seething rage twisting her face into something monstrous.

"**That little brat!**" she roars, her voice laced with venom. "**He dares to stroll in like nothing happened?! Completely unharmed?! Acting like he owns the place?! And what is this nonsense?! Bringing in outsiders like stray dogs?!**"

Her breathing is heavy, erratic, her nails digging into the wood as if it alone can bear the weight of her fury.

Fang Zheng stands stiffly, his face dark, his lips pressed into a tight line. His hands are clenched into fists at his sides, veins bulging. His anger simmers beneath the surface, a storm barely contained.

"**Where was he?!**" His voice is low, dangerous. "**What was he doing all night?!**"

His sharp gaze **snaps to Wang Er and Old Man Wang**, and the temperature in the room seems to drop. His eyes, filled with suspicion and a dangerous glint, bore into them like knives.

"**You two.**" His tone is like ice, cutting straight through them. "**Tell me everything. Right now.**"

The servants move in closer, their expressions cold and hostile. What was once their home now feels like a trial chamber.

Old Man Wang and Wang Er **freeze** under the weight of their gazes.

One wrong word.

One single **hesitation**—

And they would be caught.

Their throats dry up, their minds scream at them to be careful.

But Fang Yuan had already given them their script.

And **deviation was not an option.**

Old Man Wang forces himself to step forward, his voice steady despite the sweat beading at his temples.

"Everything happened exactly as Young Master Fang Yuan said," he states firmly, his words **absolute**. "They visited our village, saw my daughter selling meat in the market, and Young Master Fang Yuan took a liking to her. He wished to take her as a maid, and we were honored by his request."

Fang Zheng narrows his eyes. "**You just agreed? Just like that? Without a second thought?**"

Old Man Wang lowers his head in respect, his tone unwavering. "**Young Master Fang Yuan is a Gu Master. We are mere mortals.** For someone of his standing to take notice of my daughter… it is our **fortune**. To serve him is a blessing, an opportunity beyond our wildest dreams."

His voice is steady, but **his hands tremble behind his back**. Not from fear of Fang Zheng.

From **fear of the one who had ordered them to say this.**

Fang Zheng’s jaw tightens. His instincts scream that something is off, but no cracks appear in the old man's words.

"So you're telling me," he says slowly, his voice filled with restrained fury, "that he just **happened** to want your daughter as a maid? And you, as a father, simply handed her over?"

Wang Er swallows hard, panic creeping in. His mind races, his nerves stretched taut.

"We—We didn’t just—!" He stops himself abruptly, realizing he was about to say too much.

His mind flashes back to the **massacre, the blood, the beast that fled in terror, and the laughter that chilled his soul**.

His heart pounds violently in his chest. His face drains of color.

He had **almost spoken the truth**.

Old Man Wang **immediately** steps in, his voice smooth, practiced. "Of course, it wasn’t an easy decision," he says, keeping his tone firm yet humble. "**But Young Master Fang Yuan is powerful. Wise. He promised a good life for my daughter. What father wouldn’t accept such a fate for his child?**"

Wang Er **shuts his mouth**, nodding stiffly. His pulse thunders in his ears.

The lie—**no, the truth as Fang Yuan willed it**—had been restored.

His aunt scoffs, shaking her head in disgust. "**A ‘good life’? Hah! That boy can’t even manage his own life! And now he dares to bring home a servant as he pleases? Does he think this household is his playground?!**"

Her anger is palpable, thick in the air, crackling like an impending storm.

Fang Zheng asks, "Then explain **why** he stayed the night at your house."

Old Man Wang doesn’t hesitate.

"It was late. They were hungry. My daughter cooked, and after they ate, there was no sense in traveling back in the dark. It was safer for them to stay until morning. We were honored—**blessed**—by his presence."

His words are final, unshakable.

A suffocating silence follows.

Fang Zheng watches them like a hawk, scrutinizing every flicker of movement, every twitch, every breath.

But he finds nothing.

Because **there is nothing to find.**

Fang Yuan had **decided this was reality**.

And **reality bent to his will.**

After a long, tense pause, Fang Zheng **clicks his tongue in frustration** and steps back.

"…Fine," he mutters, his voice sharp with barely contained fury. "We’ll talk about this later."

His aunt lets out a frustrated growl, her hands balling into fists. "**Get lost before my eyes!**" she snaps, her voice filled with fury and disgust.

Old Man Wang and Wang Er bow their heads. They **don’t dare breathe in relief**. Their backs are drenched in sweat, but they keep their posture straight, obedient.

Even though Fang Yuan is not here, his **presence lingers—an unshakable shadow**.

A servant steps forward, his expression cold and commanding. "Follow me."

They obey **without question**, their feet moving before their minds can think.
