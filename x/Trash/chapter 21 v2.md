Memories surge through Fang Yuan’s mind, vivid as if they were happening all over again.

---
The mountain forest was boundless, sunlight filtering through the canopy, painting the forest floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow. Fang Yuan, a lean figure with sharp eyes, moved with a patient, predatory grace. He was hunting wild boar, a task that had so far proven fruitless. “Damn,” he muttered under his breath, the vastness of Qing Mao Mountain pressing in on him. He was a Rank one middle stage Gu Master, but even that meager strength felt insignificant in the face of the wilderness. He changed his strategy. "The mountain foot," he decided, "near the mortal villages. That's where they'll be."

He descended, the terrain growing less rugged, until he spotted a wisp of smoke curling upwards. He moved cautiously, experience from his previous life guiding him, until he came upon a small, humble village nestled beside a river. It was one of the many settlements under the control of the Gu Yue village. He scanned the ground, his eyes catching the telltale signs – deep prints, broken undergrowth. "Boar tracks," he realized, a flicker of anticipation in his eyes. He followed the trail, deeper into the surrounding woods.

The tracks led him to a pit, crudely dug and camouflaged. At the bottom, a large wild boar thrashed in agony, impaled on sharpened bamboo stakes. Blood pooled in the pit. "A hunter's trap," Fang Yuan observed, a thin smile playing on his lips. "Looks like I'm reaping the rewards." But the smile faded quickly. "These traps are a danger to me too." He considered the implications, the risk of falling into such a trap himself. He couldn't afford to be careless. With a flick of his wrist, a moonblade, a crescent of shimmering blue light, shot out, slicing through the boar's thick neck. The beast let out a final, guttural squeal before collapsing.

Just as Fang Yuan was about to claim his prize, he heard voices approaching. He quickly concealed himself behind a thick tree trunk. "Second brother Wang, you're the best hunter in the village!" The voices grew closer. Four young hunters emerged from the trees. The leader, a tall, muscular youth named Wang Er, swaggered confidently, a bow slung across his back. He boasted about his hunting prowess. Fang Yuan watched them, his expression unreadable. He knew he couldn't take the boar openly. These mortals, though weak individually, could be a nuisance.

Wang Er spotted Fang Yuan. "Hey, kid! What do you think you're doing? That's _my_ boar!" he snarled, his face reddening with anger. Fang Yuan, without a word, acted. He flicked his wrist, and another moonblade flashed out. It wasn't aimed at Wang Er, but at one of the other hunters. The moonblade sliced through the unfortunate youth's right forearm, severing it cleanly. The boy screamed in agony, clutching the bleeding stump. The other two hunters dropped to their knees, begging for mercy, their faces pale with terror.

Wang Er, his bravado momentarily forgotten, stared at Fang Yuan with a mixture of fear and rage. He instinctively reached behind him and grabbed his bow and arrow. "Stop right there!" he shouted, nocking an arrow. Fang Yuan ignored him. Another moonblade, faster this time, shot towards Wang Er. "Unappreciative bastard," Fang Yuan hissed.

Wang Er, driven by a mixture of desperation and anger, sidestepped the moonblade. He released his arrow. It flew swiftly towards Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan ducked, the arrow whistling harmlessly over his head. He closed the distance between them, moving with surprising speed. Wang Er, realizing that ranged combat was useless, threw down his bow and charged at Fang Yuan, his fists clenched.

"Die!" Wang Er roared, his face contorted in a mask of fury. He was much larger than Fang Yuan, his muscular frame radiating raw power. His fist, the size of a bowl, hurtled towards Fang Yuan's face.

Fang Yuan, however, was not intimidated. He sidestepped the punch with a practiced move, then twisted his body, his arm striking out, deflecting Wang Er's other hand. Wang Er, momentarily thrown off balance, grinned sinisterly. He swung his fist horizontally, aiming for Fang Yuan's back. But at that moment, the sun, high in the sky, shone directly into Wang Er's eyes.

Blinded momentarily, Wang Er's vision went blank. Fang Yuan, taking advantage of this opening, backflipped, dodging Wang Er's wild swing. As he landed, he launched his third moonblade. It followed the trajectory of the sunlight, almost invisible against the bright backdrop.

Wang Er, his senses tingling with danger, turned his head. The eerie blue moonblade flashed past. "He avoided it?" one of the kneeling hunters whispered, a flicker of hope in his eyes.

But then, a small piece of Wang Er's head flew off, accompanied by a spray of red. The moonblade, though seemingly avoided, had still found its mark. Wang Er’s body slumped to the ground.

The two remaining hunters stared in disbelief. "Second brother Wang…?" one of them stammered.

Fang Yuan stood up, brushing off his clothes. "That Wang Er was indeed skilled," he mused. "But not skilled enough." He glanced at the corpse, a cold glint in his eyes. "Big fish eat small fish. That's the way of the world."

He continued on his way, deeper into the forest. Eventually, he came upon a small, isolated wooden house. It was old, covered in moss, and surrounded by a bamboo fence. A young woman, beautiful and graceful, was drawing water from a well. An old man, his face etched with wrinkles, came out to help her. It was Old Man Wang, Wang Er’s father.

Fang Yuan approached, his expression cold and detached. The peaceful scene was about to be shattered. "Are you Old Man Wang?" he asked, his voice flat.

The old man, sensing danger, immediately knelt before Fang Yuan. "This old man pays his respects to Lord Gu Master!"

"Old Man Wang," Fang Yuan said, his voice cutting through the air, "your son offended me. I have executed him. Bring his corpse forward!"

The two hunters, still under Fang Yuan’s command, dragged Wang Er’s body forward. The young woman screamed, rushing to her brother’s side.

Fang Yuan ignored her grief. "Old Man Wang," he continued, "I hear you are a skilled hunter. Draw me a map of all the traps in this area, and mark the territories of the wild beasts. Do this, and I will spare your family. Refuse, and…" He left the threat hanging in the air.

Old Man Wang, his face a mask of despair, nodded. He knew he had no choice. He begged for his daughter's life. The young woman, consumed by grief and rage, tried to attack Fang Yuan, but her father stopped her, slapping her hard across the face.

"Do you want to die too?" he cried, his voice filled with anguish. "Do you want to leave me alone in this world?"

Tears streamed down the young woman’s face. She knew her father was right.

Fang Yuan ordered the hunters to fetch paper and brush. Old Man Wang, his hands trembling, began to draw. He worked for a long time, filling several sheets of bamboo paper with intricate details. Finally, he handed the map to Fang Yuan.

Fang Yuan examined it carefully. "This is good," he said, then his voice changed. "But I don't trust you."

Before Old Man Wang could react, Fang Yuan's moonblade flashed. The old man's head was severed from his body, blood spurting from the neck. "Father!" the young woman shrieked, lunging towards her father’s corpse.

Fang Yuan turned to her, another moonblade forming in his hand. "Splat." The young woman fell to the ground, a thin red line appearing on her face, widening into a bloody gash.

Fang Yuan looked at the three corpses, his face devoid of emotion.

---
The scene fades, and Fang Yuan's mind snaps back to the present.

Suddenly, he throws his head back and bursts into laughter.

"Ha ha ha! Not bad, not bad!" His voice rings through the tense air. "Life and death—what a joke! All living beings struggle, clawing for survival, and yet, in the face of death, what difference is there between a man and a pig? Royals or peasants, weak or strong—it doesn’t matter! In the end, we all rot the same way! Ha ha ha! Good philosophy, don’t you think?"

His laughter echoes, chilling and unfettered.

Everyone stares at him in stunned silence. Old Man Wang, in particular, looks deeply unsettled.

Then—abruptly—Fang Yuan falls silent.

The shift is eerie. His expression slackens. His eyes dim, as if something inside him has withered.

He tilts his head slightly.

"Big fish eat small fish. Small fish eat shrimp. That is nature’s way." His voice is quiet, almost thoughtful. "There is no innocence, only the food chain."

His gaze locks onto Old Man Wang. "Tell me, what do you think of that?"

The words feel like a noose tightening.

Old Man Wang’s mouth opens, but no sound comes out.

Gu Wang and Wang Er glance at each other, confused. They don’t understand what’s happening—why Fang Yuan is speaking like this, why their father is trembling.

Then, in an instant, Fang Yuan’s expression shifts again.

Tears stream down his face as he clutches his chest, his body wracked with visible sorrow. His voice breaks with grief.

"How… how could you? How could you be so cruel?" he cries, his shoulders shaking. "Don't you have any love in your heart? How can you slaughter them so mercilessly? Do you even understand the pain of losing someone? Of watching your family torn apart?"

His voice chokes with raw emotion. "And yet, knowing all this, you still kill. And worse, sometimes, you let them go—just so you can track them back to their families and slaughter them all together. How could you?"

Old Man Wang’s face turns deathly pale. His lips tremble, but no sound comes out. His breathing grows erratic. His vision blurs.

Gu Wang stares at her father, eyes wide. "Father… what is he talking about?"

Wang Er’s voice is weak. "Is… is it true? Did you really…?"

Fang Yuan suddenly turns to them, his tear-streaked face full of anguish.

"Your father is a monster!" he cries. "He kills them without mercy, knowing they had families, knowing they never harmed him!"

Old Man Wang opens his mouth, struggling for words—

But Fang Yuan steps forward, his face twisting again.

The sorrow vanishes.

Cruelty takes its place.

His eyes sharpen like knives. His expression turns deadly.

"Old Man Wang," he whispers, voice soft, yet more terrifying than before. "If you lie, I will kill you.

The weight of Fang Yuan's aura presses down, suffocating.

"Answer me," Fang Yuan commands. His tone leaves no room for escape. "Have you killed them mercilessly, knowing they had families?"

Old Man Wang’s entire body quakes. Beads of sweat drip down his forehead. In his mind, he relives the horrors of the past—the blood, the screams, the helpless eyes staring up at him.

His lips quiver. His knees buckle.

Finally, with great effort, he exhales a shuddering breath and whispers, "Yes… I have."

The world seems to freeze.

A shudder runs through the room.

Gu Wang and Wang Er stare at him, their faces contorted in disbelief.

Gu Wang’s breath catches. She takes a step back, as if struck.

"Father… what are you saying?!" Wang Er cries. "Have you gone mad?!"

Gu Wang’s hands ball into fists, her body trembling. "No… this must be a lie. Tell me it's a lie!"

Fang Yuan steps forward with righteous fury, his presence towering like a divine judge.

"Innocent lives were taken," he declares, his voice ringing with conviction. "Justice must be served. What do you all say?"

Old Man Wang collapses to his knees, his hands pressing against the cold ground.

"Esteemed Gu Master!" he cries. "Spare me! I swear—I swear I will never hunt again! I will never harm another living soul!"

Wang Er shakes his head violently, his voice desperate. "Father, tell me this isn’t real… Tell me you had a reason!"

Gu Wang falls to her knees before Fang Yuan, her voice breaking. "Even if my father did something wrong, I know him! I know he must have had a reason! If justice must be done… then take my life in his place!"

The air grows thick with sorrow.

Gu Xianer, silent until now, tugs on Fang Yuan’s sleeve. Her eyes shimmer with unshed tears.

"Brother…" she whispers. "Gu Wang is my friend. They’ve helped us. They’re not bad people." Her voice wavers. "Please…"

For a moment, silence reigns.

Then, Fang Yuan laughs. A light, almost playful chuckle.

Before anyone can react, His hand shoots out, grabbing Gu Xianer’s cheeks and squishing them like a playful older brother.

"Alright, alright, since my little sister has spoken, I’ll forgive them," he announces with an exaggerated sigh.

Gu Wang, still on her knees, bows deeply. "Thank you… thank you so much!"

The heavy tension lifts—though fear still lingers.

After a few moments, Gu Xianer looks at Old Man Wang with hesitant eyes.

"Uncle… I don’t think you’re a bad person," she says hesitantly. "But… can you tell me why you did it? Why did you kill them?"

Gu Wang and Wang Er look at their father expectantly, desperate for an answer.

Old Man Wang, still trembling, takes a deep, shaky breath. He knows Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer could snap at any moment. Every instinct tells him that speaking carelessly could be the end of him.

With a hoarse voice, he finally replies, "We are hunters. If we don’t kill… we don’t survive."

Gu Wang’s lips tremble. "But Father… have you ever killed a human?"

Old Man Wang shakes his head firmly. "No."

Silence stretches between them.

For a moment, no one speaks.

Then—

“…Animals?”

Gu Wang’s voice quivers. Her lips part as if she wants to say more, but no words come out.

Wang Er blinks. "You mean… you were talking about hunting _animals_?"

Old Man Wang remains on his knees, his breath still shallow, his face drained of color. He looks at Fang Yuan, almost afraid to answer. Then, with great difficulty, he nods.

"Yes," he croaks. "I… only hunt animals."

A heavy pause.

Gu Wang’s eyes widen. Her body trembles—not from fear anymore, but sheer, overwhelming frustration.

"WHAT?!" she explodes.

Wang Er slumps against the wall, gripping his chest as if he'd just been revived from the dead. "Hunting animals… _Just animals_?" he repeats, his voice hollow.

Even Gu Xianer, who had been tightly clutching Fang Yuan’s sleeve, lets out a deep sigh of relief. "Brother… you scared me," she murmurs, rubbing her eyes.

But Fang Yuan remains silent.

Then—

_Sniffle._

Everyone turns to look at him.

Tears well up in Fang Yuan’s eyes. His lips tremble. His entire body starts shaking.

And then, in a _broken, grief-stricken voice_—

"How… _could_ you?"

Old Man Wang’s heart stops.

"You… heartless monster," Fang Yuan chokes out, staggering forward like a man who has just lost his entire family. His face contorts with unbearable sorrow. Tears spill down his cheeks like waterfalls.

Gu Wang and Wang Er freeze in place, their breath catching in their throats.

Fang Yuan stares straight into Old Man Wang’s eyes, his expression raw with despair.

"_Do you not feel guilt?!_" he cries. "_Do you not know the agony of losing a loved one?!_"

Old Man Wang's lips quiver.

Fang Yuan suddenly grabs his own chest, his body trembling violently. His voice grows softer, weaker, almost as if he's reliving a horrible tragedy.

"There was a little deer…" he murmurs.

Gu Wang swallows hard.

"A sweet, innocent deer… She had a mother. A kind, gentle mother who taught her how to walk, how to run, how to _love_…"

Fang Yuan lets out a hiccuping sob. His hands tremble as he clutches his face.

"But one day… the hunter came."

The room turns eerily quiet.

Gu Wang, Wang Er, and Old Man Wang don’t even blink.

Fang Yuan's hands slowly lower, revealing his face twisted in unbearable pain.

"The hunter saw her mother," he whispers, his voice shaking. "He didn't care that she had a family. He didn't care that she had a child waiting for her. He—_" Fang Yuan gasps,_ "—he raised his bow… and he _killed_ her!"

Gu Wang's heart pounds in her chest.

"And then," Fang Yuan continues, his body swaying. "As the little deer cried, as she nudged her mother’s cold body, begging her to wake up… the hunter—"

Fang Yuan’s expression darkens. His fingers curl like claws.

"_The hunter slit her throat too._"

Wang Er flinches.

Gu Wang's hands start shaking.

Old Man Wang’s breath comes out in ragged gasps.

Fang Yuan suddenly stops crying.

His eyes lift.

Slowly, he turns his tear-streaked face toward Old Man Wang.

A dark, chilling grin spreads across his lips.

"Now tell me, Old Man Wang…"

His voice drops to a whisper, cold and razor-sharp.

_"Do you know… who that hunter was?"_

Old Man Wang's body locks up. His mouth opens, but no sound comes out.

Fang Yuan tilts his head.

"It was you."

Old Man Wang’s entire body shakes violently. Sweat beads on his forehead. His breathing is erratic.

Wang Er and Gu Wang turn pale, their eyes darting toward their father in horror.

Then—

Fang Yuan lets out a soft chuckle.

Then another.

And another.

Until suddenly—

"PUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

He bursts into laughter, loud and unhinged.

Gu Wang’s head jerks up.

"…Huh?"

Wang Er's lips part in confusion.

Even Old Man Wang looks completely lost.

Fang Yuan slaps his knee, doubling over as if he just heard the funniest joke of his life.

"HA! Ahaha! Your faces—! PFFT—_priceless_!"

Gu Wang gapes at him, utterly dumbfounded. "You—_what?_"

Fang Yuan wipes his fake tears and grins.

"_Oh, come on_," he says, stretching his arms. "You all looked _so_ convinced! I mean, I didn't even say a _single_ lie, did I?"

Gu Wang’s entire face turns red.

"YOU MANIAC!" she screams.

Fang Yuan gasps dramatically. "Such harsh words, Gu Wang! Weren’t you _just_ crying for me?"

Gu Wang stomps her foot in frustration.

"That's because you made it sound like my father was a murderer!"

Fang Yuan tilts his head.

"And was I wrong?"

She freezes.

Fang Yuan leans closer, grinning mischievously.

"I mean, killing humans is bad, but killing animals is totally fine?" He smirks. "That’s like saying drowning a puppy is okay, but drowning a child is _evil_."

Gu Wang’s eye twitches.

"T-That’s not the same!"

Fang Yuan gasps, placing a hand over his chest in mock horror.

"Oh no, hypocrisy!"

Wang Er groans, rubbing his temples.

"Can we just—_not_ do this anymore?" he pleads. "I think I aged ten years just now…"

Fang Yuan shrugs.

"Sure, sure. Anyway, I’m _starving_." He claps his hands together. "I heard you two have prepared special meal for me."

Gu Wang nearly faints.

"You… you’re seriously thinking about _food_ after all that?!"

Fang Yuan grins.

"All this talk about animals dying made me crave _meat_."

Gu Wang's jaw drops. "_ARE YOU EVEN HUMAN?!_"

Fang Yuan hums thoughtfully, tapping his chin.

"Hmm… good question. What do you think, Old Man Wang?"

Old Man Wang, who has been sitting completely stiff this entire time, flinches violently. He looks at Fang Yuan with the eyes of a man who has stared _death_ in the face.

"...I think you are whatever you _want_ to be," he says hoarsely.

Fang Yuan’s grin widens.

"Good answer!" he chuckles. "You live another day!"

Old Man Wang swallows thickly.

Gu Wang glares at Fang Yuan.

"…I hate you."

Fang Yuan gasps, clutching his chest.

"Ouch, Gu Wang! After everything we’ve been through? I have heard you what you two were chatting when I was unconscious. Even I feel bad how you were crying and praying for me in silent."

Gu Wang groans and stomps away.

Wang Er collapses onto a chair.

Old Man Wang doesn’t even _try_ to move.

Gu Xianer pouts.

"Brother, stop scaring them," she mutters.

Fang Yuan sighs, "Go and bring me food. Let's see what my cute sister has prepared for me."
