Fang Yuan’s laughter halts so abruptly that the shift feels like a crack splitting through reality itself. The air thickens, heavy with an oppressive weight, as if the world itself is holding its breath. Slowly, deliberately, Fang Yuan turns his head—his gaze locking onto Wang Er.

It is not just a look; it is a predator’s stare, cold and unrelenting. Wang Er freezes under it, his body betraying him, every instinct screaming danger. Fang Yuan’s eyes are sharp, piercing, merciless—like shards of ice forged in the depths of hell. They strip away all defenses, leaving Wang Er exposed, vulnerable, naked before the abyss.

And then, Fang Yuan speaks, his voice calm, almost casual.  
“Get ready. I am going to fight you.”

Wang Er’s pupils shrink. His stomach drops. He wants to run, to escape—but his legs refuse to obey. A fight? With Fang Yuan? He knows he will die.

“D-Don’t… don’t joke like that…” Wang Er stammers, his voice trembling. “You’re a Gu Master—I—I can’t—”  

Fang Yuan cuts him off, his tone eerily serene.  
“I won’t use Gu worms.”  

Wang Er blinks, confusion flickering across his face. What?  

“I will fight you as a normal human,” Fang Yuan continues, his voice smooth, composed—as though discussing nothing more consequential than the weather. “And there is a reason why I want to fight you.”  

Hope flares faintly in Wang Er’s chest. If Fang Yuan isn’t using his powers, maybe—just maybe—he has a chance. His breathing steadies slightly, enough for him to force out a question.  
“W-What reason…?”  

Fang Yuan smiles.  

It is not a kind smile.  

It is the grin of a man who has already killed you once.  

His voice remains calm. Terrifyingly, impossibly calm.  
“Because in my previous life, it was quite hard to kill you.”  

Silence.  

A suffocating, deathly silence blankets the room.  

Gu Wang’s face contorts in disbelief.  
“CAN’T YOU ACT NORMALLY FOR ONCE?! HOW CAN YOU JUST SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?!” she screams, her voice raw with frustration.  

Fang Yuan turns to her, blinking slowly. Then, with the same unsettling calmness, he replies:  
“I have already told you before. In my previous life, I killed your entire family.”  

The room erupts into chaos.  

“WHAT?!” Gu Wang shrieks, her mind short-circuiting. Old Man Wang’s legs tremble violently. Wang Er nearly collapses where he stands.  

The sheer casualness of Fang Yuan’s words is what unnerves them most. It isn’t a threat—it’s a statement. As mundane as saying, “I had breakfast,” or “It rained yesterday.”  

Fang Yuan continues unperturbed, his tone conversational.  
“I might have done the same in this life as well… but…”  

His voice softens. His gaze warms.  

“…I changed.”  

He pauses, glancing at Gu Xianer.  

“Because of my cute little sister.”  

In one swift motion, he grabs her face, squishing her cheeks playfully.  
“If you weren’t my sister, I might have never seen the light.”  

His fingers knead her soft cheeks gently, his expression melting into pure adoration.  
“Ohhh, my cute sister. My precious sister. The only one who helped me believe in love again.”  

His voice quivers with emotion.  
“If you hadn’t been born, I might have remained a monster forever.”  

Gu Xianer blinks, utterly oblivious to the gravity of his words. She smiles sweetly, grabbing onto his sleeves.  
“Brother~” she giggles.  

Fang Yuan laughs—a sound both tender and unhinged.  
“HAHAHAHAHA! SO CUTE! SO PURE!”  

He pulls her close, rubbing his cheek against hers.  
“MY XIANER! YOU ARE MY SAVIOR! MY LIGHT! MY MOST TREASURED EXISTENCE!”  

Meanwhile, Gu Wang stands twitching violently. Her fists clench until her knuckles turn white. Her blood pressure spikes. Her soul feels torn apart by the whirlwind of emotions raging inside her—rage, frustration, disbelief—and yet, beneath it all, a strange softness lingers when she looks at Gu Xianer.  

Her innocent face. Her pure, oblivious heart.  

She doesn’t understand how insane her brother truly is.  

Gu Wang rubs her temples, inhaling deeply, exhaling slowly. And then, she explodes.  
“STOP TALKING LIKE THAT! STOP SQUEEZING HER FACE! STOP SAYING SUCH INSANE THINGS LIKE YOU’RE JUST DISCUSSING THE WEATHER! STOP! STOP! STOP!”  

Fang Yuan turns to her, his smile too wide, his voice too calm.  
“…Gu Wang.”  

Her entire body locks up. She knows that tone. That face. That madness.  

Fang Yuan takes a step forward. Gu Wang takes a step back.  

“Do you… want me to fight you too?”  

Gu Wang spins around and runs, screaming at the top of her lungs.  
“SCREW THIS, I’M LEAVING! I’M DONE! I CAN’T HANDLE THIS ANYMORE!”  

Fang Yuan throws his head back and laughs—a wild, unhinged cackle that echoes into the night like the wail of a demon reveling in destruction.  

When the laughter fades, Fang Yuan looks at Wang Er again, his voice calm and chilling.  
“Wang Er, do you want proof that I killed you all in my previous life?”  

Wang Er freezes, his throat too dry to speak.  

Gu Wang stops running, her temper snapping.  
“SHOW ME THE PROOF! ENOUGH OF YOUR NONSENSE! IF YOU REALLY KILLED US, THEN SHOW ME! PROVE IT!”  

Fang Yuan tilts his head slightly, his voice gentle, almost sorrowful.  
“Are you sure?”  

Gu Wang glares.  
“OF COURSE, I’M SURE!”  

Fang Yuan sighs softly, his tone pitying.  
“Will you be able to handle it? Seeing your entire family—and yourself—being killed before your eyes?”  

The words hang in the air, suffocating.  

Gu Wang doesn’t flinch. Her frustration burns brighter than fear.  
“STOP TALKING IN CIRCLES AND JUST SHOW ME ALREADY!”  

Fang Yuan smiles faintly, his gaze drifting to Old Man Wang.  
“Old Man Wang, do you think she’ll be able to handle it?”  

Old Man Wang stiffens, trembling. He tries to respond, but no sound comes out.  


A storm brews within the endless void of Fang Yuan’s consciousness.

A battle unseen by the world rages—one of logic against chaos, of control against absolute madness.

Two voices clash, their words cutting through the infinite abyss like blades.

One, cold and merciless, a ruler of reason and calculation—Administrator Fang Yuan.  
The other, wild and untamed, reveling in unpredictability and insanity—Unpredictable Fang Yuan.

A voice, sharp as a thousand knives, erupts first.

—Administrator Fang Yuan speaks.

"What the hell are you doing?!"

His voice is calm, yet beneath it simmers a fury that threatens to tear apart existence itself.

"I predicted that after your two selves—Demonic Fang Yuan and Naive Fang Yuan—merged, you would become unpredictable. But this? This is beyond unpredictability. This is madness!"

A brief pause, as if restraining himself.

"You are forcing me to waste my power unnecessarily. Do you even comprehend the consequences? The cost? Or have you abandoned reason entirely in favor of insanity?"

For a moment, silence lingers in the void.

Then—

Laughter.

Not just any laughter—madness incarnate, a cacophony of unhinged delight and boundless amusement.

Unpredictable Fang Yuan speaks.

"Ah, Administrator, Administrator, Administrator…"

He smirks, eyes gleaming with a manic light, his entire being trembling with exhilaration.

"How adorably naïve you sound."

He takes a step forward, arms spread wide as if embracing the very concept of chaos.

"After Demonic Fang Yuan and Naive Fang Yuan merged, I realized something utterly fascinating."

His voice dips into a mocking whisper, filled with eerie amusement.

"You are nothing but a will."

Then—his expression warps, shifting between exaggerated awe and eerie amusement.

"Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no! I take it back! You’re POWERFUL! SO powerful, in fact, that even I, the magnificent, ever-evolving Fang Yuan, cannot fully comprehend you!"

He clutches his chest, staggering backward, gasping as if the sheer weight of Administrator Fang Yuan’s existence is too much to bear.

"SUCH MIGHT! SUCH TERRIFYING MIGHT! AND YET… AND YET…"

His voice drops into a whisper, slithering through the silence like a venomous serpent.

"You. Don’t. Use. It."

Administrator Fang Yuan remains silent. Unmoved.

But Unpredictable Fang Yuan presses closer, his smile twisting into something far more sinister.

"Why? Oh, let me take a WILD stab in the dark!"

He snaps his fingers, and his grin stretches wider, his eyes gleaming with eerie amusement.

"Ah, I have it! You’re like a man sitting atop an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons but refusing to fire them. Why? Because the moment you press that beautiful, shiny red button—BOOM! The enemy presses theirs too. Mutual destruction. Annihilation. Nothingness."

His laughter erupts, twisted, full of delight.

"So that’s it, isn’t it? You’re not afraid of USING your power. You’re afraid of what happens AFTER. Because once you unleash yourself, something else will wake up. Something even YOU can’t handle."

His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper.  
“You have so much power, yet you can’t tell me why or how. The restriction of Forbidden Knowledge… how frustrating.”

His eyes glow, his grin stretching unnaturally wide.  
“I am devouring you… and you’re helping me. No, it’s as if you _want_ this. It almost feels like you _are_ me. Ha ha ha… But I can’t consume you completely—not the parts that contain Forbidden Knowledge.”

He inhales deeply, savoring something unseen.  
“But I can _smell_ it. The scent of Forbidden Knowledge lingers on you. If I gather enough Forbidden Power, I _will_ absorb you completely. Every last trace of you will become _me._" His laughter grows wilder. "The more Forbidden Power I obtain, the more of you I can take. Looks like I need to go hunting. Ha ha ha!”

A pulse ripples through the void, heavy with unseen force.

Administrator Fang Yuan speaks, his voice smooth, certain.  
“Good. You’ve grasped it on your own.”

His body shakes with laughter, exhilaration radiating from him.  
"Every part of you I absorb makes me stronger. I can _feel_ it—my body, my mind, my very being reshaping, evolving. The change is too subtle to see, yet too profound to deny!"

He pauses, tilting his head as though pondering the mysteries of existence.

Then, with sudden intensity, his gaze pierces through Administrator Fang Yuan.

"I have realized something far greater than power."

His tone shifts, no longer mere amusement, but a declaration of truth.

"Before, I was a fool chasing after a coin—my so-called 'dream.' But now? Now, I see the sun. No—the entire sky. My dream is no longer a simple, insignificant thing. It has expanded beyond mortal comprehension. The journey itself has become my ecstasy! Why wait until the end to enjoy life? No, no, no! Every moment must be thrilling! Exciting! MEMORABLE!"

His expression softens slightly, an eerie warmth flickering in his gaze.

"And then there’s my sister. She gives me something I had long forgotten—warmth. Love. Something pure in this wretched world."

Then—his smile sharpens again.

"But the rest of humanity…?"

His eyes darken, amusement curling into something far more sinister.

"They are my playthings. Their fear, their humiliation, their emotions—they fuel me. I take delight in it. Teasing them, breaking them, watching them squirm—it’s art. A beautiful, twisted art that only I can perfect."

His laughter hums through the abyss, intoxicating, endless.

"So tell me, Administrator, tell me—"

He leans in, eyes glinting with devilish mischief.

"What will you do? Can you stop me? Can you control me? CAN YOU EVEN KEEP UP WITH ME?!"

Silence.

Then—

A single breath.

Administrator Fang Yuan speaks.

His voice is quiet. Ice-cold. Absolute.

"You are mistaken."

A pulse of unfathomable energy surges through the void.

Administrator Fang Yuan’s eyes gleam with something far beyond mere calculation.

"You may think yourself free, wild, untamed. But you are incomplete."

Unpredictable Fang Yuan’s grin falters, just slightly.

Administrator Fang Yuan steps forward, his presence overshadowing even the boundless madness.

"Your madness is nothing before my will. And you will remember this, Unpredictable Fang Yuan—if ever the time comes where we must use Spring Autumn Cicada…"

The void darkens.

The air grows suffocating.

A power unseen, unfathomable, trembles beneath reality itself.

Administrator Fang Yuan’s gaze pierces through the chaos.

"I will make you follow my path."

For the first time—Unpredictable Fang Yuan is silent.

A moment passes.

Then—

A slow, creeping grin spreads across his face.

Then—

Laughter.

Wild. Unchained. A melody of pure, raw, untamed chaos.

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

He throws his head back, cackling like a demon who has just heard the funniest joke in existence.

"Oh, Administrator, dear Administrator!"

His eyes gleam, his voice trembling with uncontrollable amusement.

"Always so serious. Always so rigid. Always so predictable."

He leans forward, his smile dripping with teasing mockery.

"Let’s see whose will prevails when the time comes, shall we?"

Administrator Fang Yuan’s expression does not change.

But the void trembles.

Somewhere, deep within Fang Yuan’s soul—the battle continues.


Then, without warning, Fang Yuan drags Old Man Wang’s mind into the memories of his past life.  

---
The Memory  

The mountain looms tall, the forest vast. Sunlight filters through the canopy, painting patterns of light and shadow on the ground.  

Young Fang Yuan moves with predatory grace, hunting silently. After hours of searching, he finds a wild boar trapped in a hunter’s snare, crying out in pain.  

Four young hunters arrive, led by Wang Er, arrogant and confident. Upon seeing Fang Yuan claiming the boar, Wang Er shouts angrily.  

"Hey, kid! That’s my boar! How dare you steal my hunt!"  

Fang Yuan says nothing. Instead, he acts. A flash of blue light severs one hunter’s arm. Wang Er retaliates with an arrow, but Fang Yuan dodges effortlessly.  

Another flash of light. Wang Er’s head tilts grotesquely. His body collapses. Dead.  

Later, Fang Yuan visits a small wooden house. An old man steps outside, kneeling immediately.  

"This old man pays his respects to Lord Gu Master!"  

"Your son offended me," Fang Yuan says flatly. "I executed him."  

Two hunters drag Wang Er’s corpse forward. The young woman inside screams. The old man collapses in grief.  

Fang Yuan demands a map. In exchange, he promises their lives. But after receiving the map, his demeanor shifts.  

"I don’t trust you."  

A blade flashes. The old man’s head rolls to the ground.  

The young woman lunges at Fang Yuan, tears streaming down her face.  

A casual flick of his wrist. A thin red line appears on her throat. Blood gushes. Her body falls.  

---

Old Man Wang snaps back to reality, convulsing violently. His eyes are wild, unfocused.  

He is shaking violently.

Gu Wang asks, "Father, what is wrong with you. Have you really seen anything?"

He doesn't responds as if his is not a living thing rather a sculpture.

Then, Gu Wang looks at Fang Yuan and shouts, "What Have you done!"

Fang Yuan responds calmly, "I have just seen him the memory of I killing all of you!"

Gu Wang shouts, "Non-sense! I don't believe! You crazy, madman! Show Me!"

Fang Yuan responds casually, "Ask your father?"
