After a few days,

Yao Le and Gu Wang are cheering for Gu Xianer. Gu Xianer also looks excited as well as nervous. “Big Brother will come soon. I haven’t learned anything properly. You two please help me. I think I can’t learn it in this short period of time.” Gu Wang responds, “Don’t worry sister Xianer, we will prepare everything while you will help us.” Yao Le responds, “Yes, we will help you to prepare everything.”

Gu Xianer responds with sorrow while tears are pouring out from her eyes, “Everyone calls me a stupid, hungry beast and pig. I know I am a burden to my family. Even though everyone is displeased with me, my big brother always supported me. He always tells me that the more I will eat the more I will become strong and intelligent. He always calls me princess, beautiful. I know I don’t deserve it but I want to do something for my brother. I don’t just want to be a burden on him. What can I even do as I can’t even cook for my brother.” Saying all these, She starts crying loudly. Yao Le and Gu Wang comfort her and motivate her.

  

After a few days,

At night, Gu Xianer is very tired from learning cooking for a few days without resting properly but she is cultivating to advance her rank. Gu Wang feels pity and tells, “Sister Xianer, please take some rest. You have been working very hard for the last few days. If your brother sees your lifeless face, he would be very sad.” Gu Xianer responds, “I want to advance my rank before my brother comes. I don’t know why but no matter how hard I try, I always fail to advance my ranking. Am I really a curse?” Saying that Gu Xianer starts crying. Gu Wang comforts her. After some time, Gu Xianer calms herself down. Gu Xianer and Gu Wang are lying on the bed while looking at each other. After discussing for some time, they feel sleepy. Suddenly, they feel that they are not looking at each other, rather there is someone between them. Gu Wang becomes shocked and quickly jumps off the bed. Gu Xianer also becomes shocked but she quickly embraces and starts crying. Even though the room is dark, Gu Xianer can easily identify Fang Yuan. It is just her instinct that allows her to identify Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan also embraces her as her eyes look innocent. Fang Yuan says while tears are pouring out from his eyes like steam without any sound , “Please don’t cry, my princess. I am here. I will beat everyone up who has made you cry.” After a while, Gu Xianer calms down. Then, Fang Yuan gives something to eat and tries to feed her but Gu Xianer insists that she will feed him today. Fang Yuan responds, “How about you feed me next day because I am excited to eat something which is prepared by my adorable little sister.” Gu Xianer responds, “Ok, then brother you will also have to help me prepare everything.” Fang Yuan responds, “Ok, My queen as your order.” 

Fang Yuan orders gently, “Now, open your mouth. Ha” Gu Xianer opens her mouth with satisfaction as if she has been waiting for this moment for eternity. While feeding and eating with Gu Xianer, Fang Yuan orders Gu Wang to come near and sit on the bed. Gu Wang obediently follows his order subconsciously. Then Fang Yuan asks Gu Xianer, “Is Gu Wang good to you? Does she help you and support you? Or does she make fun of you like others?” Gu Xianer responds quickly, “No no no, Gu Wang is very good. She is always good to me and always helps me.” “How about Yao Le? Is she a good girl?” “Yes, she is my friend. She helps me a lot during this time. We all are good friends.” Fang Yuan orders Gu Wang to open her mouth. Gu Wang as well as Gu Xianer become startled. Gu Wang responds, “I don’t need it.” Fang Yuan asks, “Are you not a good girl?” Gu Wang can’t respond and open her mouth gently while feeling shy and blushing. She tries to look at Fang Yuan’s face but can’t because of her shyness.

  

After sometime,

Fang Yuan uses many gu worms to help Gu Xianer advance her rank. Gu Wang is observing the process. She becomes astonished seeing Fang Yuan using more than a million primeval stones. Gu Xianer asks, “Brother, how have you got so many primeval stones?” Fang Yuan responds, “Haven’t I told you my biggest secret? Or did you forget it?” Gu Xianer responds, “I can’t recall.” Fang Yuan responds, “It is not my first life. I am not from this world either. I have been reborn after dying in my original world. All the stories that I have told you are from my original world.” Gu Xianer responds, “I thought that it was a part of the story.” Fang Yuan responds, “You think this way because I have never told you directly. I have only told you as if it is just a story.” Gu Wang becomes shocked and shouts fearfully, “I will not tell anyone about it.” when Fang Yuan looks at Gu Wang. Fang Yuan responds, “I am telling you it because I believe you. So, don’t worry.” Hearing this, Gu Wang blushes from shyness and can’t look at Fang Yuan. 

In the morning, Gu Xianer and Gu Wang are sleeping while embracing Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan calls Gu Wang but she doesn’t wake up because they have only slept for less than 1 hour. So, Fang Yuan takes Gu Wang on her lap and leaves the place quickly so that Gu Xianer doesn’t wake up. Because Fang Yuan has used more than 3 million primeval stones to advance Gu Xianer to rank 3 but sealed it off to rank 1 middle stage. Now, her cultivation speed will be normal and she will not feel that much difficulty advancing her level.

  

Gu Want wakes up and sees that she is on Fang Yuan’s lap. She tries to shout but Fang Yuan tells her not to make a sound. Then Fang Yuan whispers in Gu Wang’s ear, “Don’t feel shy because I am your master and you are my maid.” Gu Wang can’t process anything and she feels extremely shy thinking many bad things are going to happen. But Fang Yuan puts her down on the floor and tells her to sit down. Then Fang Yuan uses some gu worm on Gu Xianer, so that she can sleep properly without any interruption. Gu Wang is obediently sitting on the floor while looking at the floor but she tries to peek at Fang Yuan but can’t find the courage to do it. Then Fang Yuan sits behind Gu Wang and uses hope gu to open her aperture. She becomes shocked that she has just become a Gu Master. Before she can do anything, Fang Yuan starts using many gu worms with hundreds of thousands of primeval stones. After 5 hours, Fang Yuan tells Gu Wang to take some rest and not think too much. Just pretend nothing has happened.

  

Gu Wang goes to bed and falls asleep as she is extremely tired. Fang Yuan has used more than 1.5 million spiritual stones to advance her cultivation to rank 5 within just 5 hours with the help of many Gu Worms. Even though It has already damaged her potential, it is worth it. Gu Xianer needs more than 3 million primeval stones just to advance to rank 3 initial stage because of her divine healing body which has a lot of restrictions in this gu world. Her restriction would leave drastically if she can become immortal. Fang Yuan tries to make her rank 5 even if it damages some of her potential but doesn’t do it because of high risk. Even more if Fang Yuan forcefully advances her to rank 5, she would face even more restrictions like her brain would develop 5 times slower but her body would develop 5 times faster which is really a curse. Because It would force her to become very old at her young age. Which will make her not to even survive 20 years. Which is quite good.

  

After sometimes,

Gu Xianer wakes up and says with sleepyhead, “Brother, are you here? Or was that just a dream?” Fang Yuan comes close and responds, “I am here, my adorable cute sister. Go and fresh up. I have prepared your favourite dishes.” Gu Xianer responds, “Why have you prepared? I am the one who will prepare today.” Fang Yuan responds, “Ok, you will prepare for noon. Now, go and fresh up.”

  

At the sametime in Fang Zheng’s room,

Fang Zheng ponders, “So, there is nothing wrong with Fang Yuan. It looks like the event is repeating itself in a different way. Is it really fate? I met with Fang Yuan this morning and asked him various things. So, It is not the reborn Fang Yuan who is a monster. It must be his first life before using Spring Autumn Cicada. When I asked him what he was doing with the clan leader, he responded saying that he was cultivating. He even told me that he is going to leave the village the next day. I have thought that Fang Yuan would not leave this mountain as his life isn’t as bad as I had written in my novel. But It looks like I have really underestimated the power of Heaven’s Will. It must be the work of Heaven’s Will. But no problem, If it goes as I have written from now on, It would take more than 600 years for Fang Yuan to reach rank 6. Ha ha ha.”

  

At uncle and aunt’s room,

Fang Yuan’s aunt asks, “What is wrong with this lad? What do he think he is?” Uncle responds, “Don’t worry. It is good for us. We don’t need to give our inheritance to him. And even more he is only a d-grade talent who can never do anything in his life.” Aunt responds, “But Fang Yuan told us that he is going to adventure the world to take opportunities and would come when he becomes strong.” Uncle responds, “He is young. And doesn’t have any practical experience. The clan leader must have given him basic training that is why he is thinking he is high and mighty. I am thinking that he might not even survive one month outside the village.” Aunt asks, “But he is going with the merchant caravan. He will not face any difficulty.” Uncle responds, “You don’t know anything. He will be bullied in the merchant caravan. Even more he might need to work like a slave. Sometimes even many merchant caravans were wiped out by wild beasts. I have heard that Jia Fu has transferred the merchant caravan to his stupid brother and he will not continue his journey with this caravan. Now, there are no rank 4 gu masters in the merchant caravan which makes them even more vulnerable in the wilderness. Ha ha ha”
