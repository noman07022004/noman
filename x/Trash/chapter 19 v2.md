Within Fang Yuan's mind, Administrator Fang Yuan watches the merging process unfold. A faint smile touches his lips.

_"The process will complete after sunrise. Not much time left."_

His gaze shifts toward the Gu Yue Clan’s direction. His eyes gleam with eerie amusement.

_"The clan leader is sleeping quietly… A small gift won’t be too much. I think he’ll be able to handle it. Ha ha ha."_

---
In a quiet mansion, the clan leader sleeps alone. His wife has long since passed. The night is silent.

But deep within his slumber, something stirs.

A dream grips him.

Gu Yue Bo awakens suddenly, his heart pounding. He looks around. Nothing but darkness. An endless abyss.

Confusion takes hold. _Where am I?_

In the far distance, a point of light flickers. Weak but visible. Instinct drives him forward, and he starts running—toward the light, toward salvation.

He runs madly, his breath ragged, his limbs burning. Yet no matter how much he pushes himself, the light remains out of reach. It stays far, just a dot in the infinite black.

Then—

_Boom!_

The light erupts, expanding with terrifying intensity. It grows so blinding that he shields his eyes, unable to look directly at it.

_What is this?!_

Suddenly, the brightness flickers. Shadows creep in. The light fractures, shifting—its bright parts darkening, its dark parts whitening, swirling like a cosmic tide.

Then the brilliance fades, stabilizing into something neither too bright nor too dark. Gu Yue Bo dares to open his eyes.

And he sees—

A **figure** standing in the distance.

His breath catches. His mind stumbles.

The figure is towering, impossibly vast—so colossal that Gu Yue Bo feels like an insect, less than an ant beneath its gaze.

His blood freezes. His thoughts swirl.

_Fang Yuan…? No… Fang Zheng…?_

Which one is it?

The figure’s presence is overwhelming. Godlike. Monstrous.

Then, without warning—

_Shrkk!_

The figure **shrinks** in an instant, reducing to human size. Now, he can see it clearly.

But it is not normal.

The **entire body is pitch black**, like a shadow without substance. The ground beneath them shifts—what was once solid turns into small, scattered rocks.

Gu Yue Bo stands among them, dazed, confused.

The figure crouches. And with an eerie, childlike curiosity—

**Fang Yuan picks up a rock.**

He flicks it.

_Pah!_

The rock strikes Gu Yue Bo.

Pain explodes in his body. It is unbearable, suffocating—but not lethal. He drops to the ground, writhing, hands grasping at nothing.

Then—

**He dies.**

But—

His mind doesn’t fade.

A new body forms.

He gasps, alive again—but the old body remains, writhing in agony, its hands clutching its throat, struggling, suffering.

Then—

Another rock.

_Pah!_

Another death.

Another **him**—his past body—remains in torment.

Over. And over. And over.

The **same pain. The same suffering. The same agony.**

Ten times.

Ten bodies.

Yet he doesn’t die.

He lives—forced to **see himself dying**, over and over, surrounded by his own corpses, all frozen in endless suffering.

The rocks beneath them soak in blood. A **small pool of red** forms, fed by the wounds of his past selves.

Gu Yue Bo’s mind fractures. His sanity wavers.

Then—

He looks up.

And **meets Fang Yuan’s gaze.**

Gentle. Soft. Innocent.

Yet—

His eyes are an endless abyss.

A void that swallows light, hiding something infinitely more **terrifying** within.

Gu Yue Bo's fear deepens. He cannot breathe. He cannot think. His mind clears—not from peace, but from sheer **primal terror.**

Then Fang Yuan **smiles.**

He gestures toward the suffering bodies. His voice is light, almost playful.

_"How do you feel… seeing them suffer?"_

Gu Yue Bo shakes his head, unable to respond. His gaze flickers toward the bodies—two of them, further away, still rolling in pain, hands pressing their throats as if trying to stop their own blood from flowing.

The other **eight** bodies lie in a circle, their forms twisted in the agony of death.

A **ritual of suffering.**

A **painting of despair.**

Then—

The scene **shifts.**

Suddenly, they are inside a cave, dimly lit by flickering lanterns. The air is thick, heavy, suffocating.

Fang Yuan steps forward. His voice is calm, but his words **are not a request.**

_"Come here. Find me."_

_"Take me back to the village. Punish me for endangering Gu Xianer."_

_"Declare my punishment to the whole clan. Keep me in your home as a captive."_

_"And I will tell you… what to do next."_

Then—

_"Don't be late."_

A pause.

Then Fang Yuan's voice drops, filled with an **unspoken warning.**

_"Unless… you want to see yourself like this again."_

The dream shatters.

Gu Yue Bo wakes **screaming.**

Cold sweat drenches his body. His heart slams against his ribs. His breath comes in sharp, shallow gasps.

His eyes dart around, trying to **reassure himself** that he is in his room, that he is safe, that what he just saw was **not real.**

But—

His hands tremble.

His mind refuses to calm.

He doesn’t know what to do.

The night has not fully surrendered to the sun, but the thick darkness has begun to fade, replaced by a gentle, creeping light. The small kitchen, dimly illuminated by a flickering lantern, is filled with the soft crackling of firewood and the comforting scent of warm rice.

Gu Wang moves with effortless ease, hands working swiftly as she stirs the pot, the steam curling around her like a whisper. The fire beneath the stove flickers, its glow reflecting in her bright eyes.

Gu Xianer, in contrast, stands stiffly beside her, gripping a wooden spoon as if it’s a weapon she doesn’t quite know how to wield. Occasionally, she hands over ingredients or holds a bowl, but mostly, she watches.

After some time, she finally speaks. "Gu Wang, teach me."

Gu Wang glances at her in surprise. "Teach you? Teach you what?"

"Cooking."

Gu Wang’s lips curl into an amused smile. "You? Cooking?"

Gu Xianer nods, her expression serious.

Gu Wang folds her arms, pretending to think deeply. "Hmm… I don’t know. You don’t seem like someone who can cook."

Gu Xianer frowns. "Why?"

Gu Wang grins. "Because you look like someone who thinks food magically appears if you stare at it long enough."

Gu Xianer looks away. That… was not entirely wrong.

Gu Wang bursts into laughter, then ruffles her hair. "Alright, alright. Since you’re asking so nicely, I’ll share my great wisdom with you. But be warned! Cooking is an art. It requires patience, skill, and—"

Gu Xianer tilts her head. "Isn’t it just throwing food into fire?"

Gu Wang freezes. She turns slowly, staring at Gu Xianer as if she just committed the greatest crime imaginable. "WHAT?!"

Gu Xianer blinks. "I mean… food needs fire, right? So, if I throw food into the fire, it’ll cook faster."

Gu Wang gasps, clutching her chest as if physically wounded. "That is NOT cooking! That’s called making ashes!"

Gu Xianer frowns. "But meat tastes good when it touches fire, right?"

Gu Wang groans dramatically. "Yes, but that’s called roasting! And it has rules! You don’t just… _throw it into the flames_ like a crazy person!"

Gu Xianer looks genuinely confused. "So… cooking is about controlling the fire?"

Gu Wang nods, relieved. "Yes! Exactly!"

Gu Xianer ponders for a moment, then suddenly points at the fire under the pot. "So if I take the fire away, food won’t cook?"

"Right."

"And if I add more fire, it’ll cook faster?"

Gu Wang nearly chokes. "Absolutely not!"

"But why?"

"Because cooking is like taming a wild beast!" Gu Wang declares, waving a ladle like a sword. "If you’re too soft, it won’t listen to you. If you’re too rough, it’ll go crazy and ruin everything!"

Gu Xianer slowly nods, as if this is the most profound wisdom she has ever heard. "I see… cooking is like training a beast…"

Gu Wang pats her head, grinning. "Now, let’s start with something simple. Cutting vegetables." She hands over a small knife.

Gu Xianer takes it but examines it with a skeptical look. "This seems more dangerous than fighting."

Gu Wang smirks. "That’s because you’ve never seen an angry cook after someone ruins their ingredients."

Gu Xianer grips the knife carefully. "So, I just cut them into small pieces?"

Then she brings the knife down with force, slicing the vegetable apart with fierce determination. She doesn’t pause. Again and again, she strikes, dicing the poor thing into oblivion. Small chunks fly off the board, some landing on the floor.

Gu Wang stares, momentarily speechless.

"Uh… Xianer?" She leans in. "Why… are you chopping it like you’re in a life-or-death battle?"

Gu Xianer doesn’t look up. Another strike, another unfortunate piece of vegetable meeting its end. "I’m practicing my swordsmanship."

Gu Wang raises an eyebrow. "Swordsmanship?"

Gu Xianer nods, completely serious. "If anyone dares to harm my brother again…" She slices again, even more ruthlessly. "I’ll chop them up just like this."

Gu Wang barely manages to hold in her laughter, but her shoulders shake. "Xianer, are you sure you’re cooking and not… declaring war on these vegetables?"

Gu Xianer finally looks up. "Is there a difference?"

Gu Wang stares at her. "Yes! A HUGE difference!"

Gu Xianer frowns slightly. "But enemies and food both have weak points. And if you aim properly, you can cut them down in one strike."

Gu Wang groans, dramatically pressing her forehead. "No, no, no! Cooking is about love! Not revenge!"

Gu Xianer tilts her head. "Then why do you hit the dough when making bread?"

Gu Wang opens her mouth. Then closes it.

"That’s… different!" she finally says.

Gu Xianer crosses her arms. "How?"

Gu Wang sighs, patting her shoulder. "Alright, listen carefully, little warrior. You don’t chop vegetables like you’re fighting for your life. You slice them gently, evenly, so they cook properly. Food isn’t your enemy."

Gu Xianer blinks. "Then what is it?"

Gu Wang grins. "Your ally! The stronger your cooking skills, the stronger your brother will be. And if your food is delicious, your enemies will surrender before you even have to fight!"

Gu Xianer looks thoughtful. "...So cooking is also a form of battle?"

Gu Wang laughs. "Exactly!" She winks. "But a battle of love!"

Gu Xianer looks at the scattered remains of the vegetable, then at the neat slices Gu Wang has made. She exhales quietly and picks up another one, carefully trying to cut it more gently this time.

Gu Wang watches her and gives gentle smile. "It looks like I’ve managed to pull her out of her trauma, even if just a little."

As the morning light slowly brightens the kitchen, the two continue their work—one teaching, the other learning, their laughter filling the air.

---

Fang Yuan remains unconscious, but deep within his mind, Administrator Fang Yuan appears like a strict teacher about to explain an important lesson. "Congratulations. How are you feeling, Unpredictable Fang Yuan?"

Unpredictable Fang Yuan throws his head back and cackles like a madman who just discovered the meaning of life is _potatoes_. "Ha ha ha ha! **I FEEL GLORIOUS!** You’ve already given me a name, and let me tell you, it fits me better than my own skin! Ha ha ha!" He clutches his chest dramatically. "I can feel it now—the connection between you and me! It’s like a bridge made of nonsense, but it stands tall and unshakable! And I can already tell—we’re going to merge one day! But right now? Right now, I am nothing but a headless chicken running in the endless void of possibilities! HA HA HA!"

Suddenly, his eyes flash with insane clarity. He jabs a finger at Administrator Fang Yuan like a philosopher who just discovered that water is _wet_. "WAIT! I UNDERSTAND IT NOW! My mind—my personality—it’s not broken! It’s **MULTI-DIMENSIONAL!** It doesn’t clash, no! It FLOWS! Like an eternal river, sometimes calm, sometimes a raging flood! But instead of water, it’s filled with Naive Fang Yuan when talking to my sister, and Demonic Fang Yuan when facing my worst enemies! HA HA HA! It’s not even a choice! It’s like blinking! No—_more natural than blinking!_ It’s as natural as—" He gasps, eyes wide with revelation. "—_as the desire to steal from a rich fool!_ Ha ha ha ha!"

Administrator Fang Yuan watches him in utter silence. "...I was going to explain all of this to you, but somehow, your brain—if it can even be called that—has already reached the answer on its own."

Unpredictable Fang Yuan spreads his arms like a lunatic embracing the universe. "I HAVE DECIDED! FROM NOW ON, I AM THE **GREAT LOVE DEMON VENERABLE!** HA HA HA HA!"

Administrator Fang Yuan rubs his temples. "...And what path exactly are you planning to become a Venerable in?"

Unpredictable Fang Yuan grins like a man who just found a loophole in the laws of reality. "THE YIN-YANG PATH! Ha ha ha! Imagine it! I will use the power of balance! I will make my enemies stronger! I will nurture them with love, like a farmer growing the most precious crops—_only to harvest them at their peak!_ HA HA HA! I shall embrace them, cherish them, give them my boundless affection… AND THEN CUT THEM DOWN WITH MY OWN HANDS! Ha ha ha! The ultimate betrayal! The most perfect tragedy! **A LOVE SO GREAT IT DESTROYS!** Ha ha ha!"

Administrator Fang Yuan stares at him, horrified. "...Do you even hear yourself?"

Unpredictable Fang Yuan smirks. "Oh, I hear myself perfectly. In fact, my logic is flawless. The stronger my enemies, the stronger I become when I defeat them. If I love them, they grow even stronger. And if I kill them at their peak, I absorb the peak of their power! So tell me, _is there a more perfect cultivation path than this?!_"

Administrator Fang Yuan groans. "Fine, fine. Do whatever insane thing you want. But don’t you think you’re laughing a bit too much?"

Unpredictable Fang Yuan gasps. He looks at Administrator Fang Yuan as if he just heard the dumbest thing in the world. "Are you even listening?! The more you laugh, the happier you are! The happier you are, the stronger you become! The stronger you become, the less you die! And if you never die, you’ll live forever! HA HA HA HA!"

Administrator Fang Yuan rubs his forehead. "You’re just making up words now."

Unpredictable Fang Yuan winks. "Yes! And that’s the secret! If my logic is so insane that even _I_ don’t understand it, then neither will my enemies! If my enemies can’t understand it, then they can’t predict me! And if they can’t predict me, I CAN NEVER LOSE! HA HA HA HA!"

Administrator Fang Yuan sighs deeply. "...I have no words for you."

Unpredictable Fang Yuan claps his hands together. "Good! Because words are too weak to describe my greatness anyway! Ha ha ha!"

Administrator Fang Yuan closes his eyes, choosing peace. "Whatever. Just wake up soon, or I’m leaving you in this madness forever."

Unpredictable Fang Yuan gasps. "LEAVING ME?! YOU CAN’T LEAVE! YOU’RE ME!" He points dramatically. "WE ARE BOUND TOGETHER! LIKE A THIEF AND A LOCK! LIKE A SCAMMER AND A NAIVE FOOL! LIKE A VEGETABLE AND A CHOPPING BOARD! HA HA HA!"

Administrator Fang Yuan stares blankly. "...You need help."

Unpredictable Fang Yuan smirks. "No. **I need more enemies to love.** HA HA HA HA!"
