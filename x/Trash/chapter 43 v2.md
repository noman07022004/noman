Fang Yuan’s voice cuts through the air like the crack of a guillotine—cold, merciless, absolute. His expression flickers between manic amusement and chilling detachment, his every word laced with the weight of an ancient monster who has long abandoned all that makes one human.

"Then," Fang Yuan continues, his eyes glinting with an unsettling gleam that reflects not just madness but something far more sinister—a calculated detachment from all things human. "After clawing my way back through 600 years of betrayal, deception, and endless cycles of suffering, I cast aside emotions like love, affection, warmth, cuteness—mere illusions crafted by weaker minds to distract themselves from the truth." He pauses dramatically, letting the gravity of his words settle over them like a suffocating shroud before turning his gaze toward Gu Xianer.

"You, Gu Xianer," he says softly, almost tenderly, yet laced with a coldness that could freeze fire itself, "weren’t even born in that life. You didn’t exist. Not even a whisper of your existence crossed my path." A cruel smile twists his lips as he leans back, his expression darkening further, becoming something monstrous. "I was utterly detached from those feeble, positive emotions. And so, I killed. Oh, how freely I slaughtered—with supreme philosophies carved from the very essence of this world: _Big fish eat small fish._ _Humans slaughter innocent beasts and cut down defenseless trees._ So tell me, what is innocence? What is guilt? I was merely acting in accordance with the law of existence. If all things live only to die, why should I hesitate? So tell me, who among you can claim innocence? Ha ha ha! Can any of you deny the truth of my actions?"

His eyes snap toward Gu Wang and Yao Le. He drinks in their terror—the way their bodies tremble, the way their lips part in silent horror. They are frozen, ensnared in the suffocating presence of something beyond comprehension.

"The strong consume the weak; survival of the fittest—these have always been the immutable laws of this world," Fang Yuan declares, his voice rising with manic fervor, each word punctuated by a twisted glee. "The weak exist to serve the strong, They are resources, tools, prey. Their lives are only meaningful if they contribute to the desires of those above them. That is the truth of this world. Ha ha ha!"

He throws his head back, laughing louder, more deranged than ever. His face contorts into something grotesque, his eyes blazing with a mix of pride and madness. "Do not dare to call me wrong. My philosophy was right then, and it remains irrefutable now. Ha ha ha! Even now, I don't care about human life, not unless they are close to me. What is a human life, truly?" he asks. "A worm’s death, a beast’s death, a tree’s death is no different. I transcended humanity long ago. I rose beyond the petty morality of the weak. I stood at the pinnacle of all existence, looking down upon the world as a god does upon ants. Do you understand now? Ha ha ha! As well it should, given the countless lives I’ve extinguished without hesitation."

Gu Wang clutches her chest, her breathing erratic, her heart pounding so hard she fears it might burst out of her ribcage. Tears well up in her eyes, but she dares not let them fall. Beside her, Yao Le grips her sleeves tightly, her knuckles white, her entire body shaking uncontrollably. She wants to scream, to run, to do anything—but paralysis grips her, rooting her to the spot.

"With this transcendent mentality," Fang Yuan continues, his voice dropping to a sinister whisper that slithers into their ears like venom, "I began killing as I pleased. And why shouldn’t I? If you are weak, it is your fault. The weak exist only to serve the strong—to be used however we see fit. They should feel honored that their worthless lives were consumed by someone superior. Ha ha ha! Is this not the most logical argument? Isn't it the way this world work? Can you deny its perfection? Ha ha ha!"

His laughter grows louder, more hysterical, filling the space with an oppressive energy that suffocates everyone present. Then, without warning, his expression shifts, becoming eerily calm as he delivers the next blow.

"In one of my previous lives," he says, his tone now eerily soft, "I killed you both."

Gu Wang’s breath catches. Yao Le's knees buckle. The room feels as though it has collapsed into itself, as if reality itself is suffocating under the weight of his words.

"It wasn’t quick. It wasn’t merciful," Fang Yuan continues, his gaze piercing straight into their souls. "I remember it vividly. The way your bodies struggled. The way your eyes dimmed. The way your blood painted the earth, feeding the worms beneath my feet."

The air seems to freeze. Time halts as Gu Wang and Yao Le stare at him, their faces pale, their eyes wide with terror. For a moment, neither of them breathes. Gu Wang feels bile rise in her throat, her stomach churning violently. Her legs wobble, threatening to give out beneath her. Yao Se lets out a strangled gasp, her hands flying to her mouth as tears stream down her cheeks. Her mind races, trying desperately to reconcile the man standing before her with the monster he describes.

"That life stretched endlessly," Fang Yuan muses, his voice tinged with nostalgia, almost fondness, as if recalling a cherished memory. "And I returned to the past many times, each iteration bringing me power beyond imagination, reaching heights I couldn’t even dream of before. In my immediate previous life, I eradicated all living beings on this world. Ha ha ha! Not even this planet received mercy from me. Ha ha ha! I ascended beyond humanity—so high, so powerful. At one point, my views became so elevated that I saw human life as indistinguishable from a rock. No difference whatsoever. Ha ha ha!"

He pauses, tilting his head slightly, his grin widening into something grotesque, something otherworldly. "What do you think? Ha ha ha!"

Gu Wang collapses to her knees, her body wracked with sobs. She covers her ears with her hands, trying desperately to block out his words, but they seep into her mind nonetheless, poisoning her thoughts. Her whole body shakes as she cries, overwhelmed by the sheer horror of what she’s hearing. Yao Le, meanwhile, stumbles backward, her legs giving out as she slumps against the wall. Her hands tremble as she presses them against her temples, muttering under her breath, "No… no… this can’t be real…"

"But after countless ages," Fang Yuan continues, his tone shifting slightly, becoming softer, almost reflective, "I was brought back in time once again by a mysterious force. And yesterday, I fully merged with this self of mine—the naive Fang Yuan." He chuckles softly, his gaze softening as he looks at Gu Xianer. "In this life, after merging with my naive self, I feel emotions I had long abandoned—love, warmth, tenderness—all because of you, my dear sister. Even I was confused at first, thinking I had no sister in any of my previous lives."

He reaches out, gently cupping Gu Xianer's face in his hands. Tears stream down her cheeks as she listens to his story, her heart breaking for the hardships and turmoil he endured. Fang Yuan begins squeezing her cheeks playfully, his touch gentle despite the chaos swirling within him.

"My angel, my precious little sister," he murmured, his voice carrying the weight of genuine affection. "If not for you—if you had never been born in this lifetime—I might have bathed the world in blood once more. From you, I have learned love, warmth, and all the tenderness I once cast aside. Before you, I had long forgotten what it meant to feel, to care, to hold something dear. Without you, I would have walked the same path again, leaving only silence in my wake.

Thank you, my Xian’er, for existing. Thank you for showing me what it means to be human again."

Gu Xianer hiccups between her sobs, her body trembling as she clings to his sleeves, as if holding onto him could keep the shadows at bay. "Brother… I will love you as much as you want," she whispers through her tears, "and I will protect you."

Hearing this, Fang Yuan bursts into laughter once more, throwing his head back as joy and madness intertwine in his expression. "Ha ha ha! My Xianer, my adorable little sister! you are my light in this dark and wicked world. Ha ha ha!"

Gu Wang and Yao Le watch the scene unfold, their hearts torn between relief and despair. They cannot comprehend what they should feel right now. They are still shaking violently from fear, their minds traumatized, their thoughts frozen.

After playing with Gu Xianer for some time, Fang Yuan turns his attention to Gu Wang and Yao Le, his gaze softening slightly. "I think," he says with a gentle smile, "as my personal maids, you have the right to know exactly how I killed you in my previous life."
