Gu Wang’s patience shatters , her voice erupting like a volcano on the verge of collapse. Her eyes blaze with fury, her hands trembling as if they’re holding back an entire storm.  
“TELL ME! ” she screams at her father, her words sharp enough to cut steel. “What is he talking about?! Why are you silent?! ”

But Old Man Wang stands frozen, his face ashen, his eyes vacant—like a statue carved from fear itself. His lips quiver, but no sound escapes them. He looks like a man who has seen the abyss and knows there’s no point in running anymore.

Her fury shifts, blazing now toward Fang Yuan. Her fists clench so tightly that they tremble with barely contained rage.  
“ENOUGH OF YOUR NONSENSE! JUST SHOW ME OR IS THIS ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR SICK JOKES?! ”

Fang Yuan places a hand over his chest, feigning hurt with theatrical flair. His expression twists into mock sorrow, his voice dripping with exaggerated pity.  
“Oh, how tragic! My poor Gu Wang—abandoned in her time of need! Betrayed by her own father! ” He sighs dramatically, shaking his head as if mourning the loss of humanity itself.

Then, just as quickly, his tone darkens. The playful mockery vanishes, replaced by something colder, sharper—like the edge of a blade pressed against skin. His gaze pierces through Gu Wang, stripping away her defenses until she feels utterly exposed.  
“Or maybe… he just doesn’t want you to know. ”

Gu Wang’s blood boils, her temper snapping like a brittle twig underfoot. She steps forward, her body radiating suppressed anger.  
“STOP STALLING AND JUST SHOW ME! ”

Fang Yuan gasps dramatically, staggering back as if struck by an invisible force. His hands clutch his heart, his face contorting in exaggerated agony. He lets out a sigh, almost relishing the moment.  
“Such venom! Such passion! Ah, the fire of youth! How adorable! ” His grin widens, mocking her anger. “The more you shout, the more I see the tragic hero within you, Gu Wang! Every word you scream sounds like a melody of heaven. It feels like a pure, beautiful angel has descended to earth just to give me a quick lesson. ”

Gu Wang’s temple throbs visibly, her jaw tightening until it feels like it might crack.  
“STOP MESSING AROUND! SHOW ME! ”

Fang Yuan’s expression shifts again, his grin softening into something unreadable. His voice drops, slow and deliberate, sinking into an eerie whisper that sends shivers down everyone’s spines.  
“But… are you sure? ”

Gu Wang’s fists tighten further, her knuckles white as bone.  
“YES! JUST SHOW ME! ”

Fang Yuan pauses, letting the tension hang heavy in the air like storm clouds before lightning strikes. Then—his gaze drifts to Gu Xianer.

She sits there, her large innocent eyes filled with curiosity, waiting to hear what her beloved brother will do next.

And then—Fang Yuan transforms.

His chaotic, dangerous energy melts away, replaced by an overwhelming tenderness reserved only for her. His eyes, once cold and merciless, soften into a gaze so warm it could melt stone. His lips curve into the gentlest of smiles as he reaches out and strokes her hair, his fingers lingering as if she were the most precious treasure in existence.  
“Oh, my adorable, perfect, angelic little sister, ” he murmurs, his voice rich with adoration. “Who has blessed me with her cooking today and fulfilled her sacred duty as my sibling a few moments ago… Do you wish to hear a tragic tale? A tale so sorrowful it could make the heavens weep, yet so heroic that the gods themselves would kneel in awe? ”

Gu Xianer hesitates, her small voice trembling slightly. “Brother… I don’t like sad stories. ”

Fang Yuan’s eyes glisten with affection, his smile growing softer still.  
“Oh, my precious, sweet Xianer, my perfect little fairy. It is indeed a sad story. But… ” His voice lowers, becoming soothing and hypnotic. “It is also a story of a brave little sister who fought against a terrifying demon. She had no weapon, no skill, no strength—and yet—she fought. She knew she would die, yet she charged forward for love, for justice, for her father, for her brother! ”

Gu Xianer’s eyes widen, her tiny hands clutching her dress as determination flickers in her innocent gaze. “Yes, Brother. If it's about a sister fighting for her brother, then… I want to hear it! ”

Fang Yuan grins warmly, his entire demeanor radiating pride and affection.  
“Good girl. ”

Then—his eyes snap to Gu Wang.

And all warmth vanishes.

His gaze shifts towards Gu Wang, and his smile becomes domineering and teasing.  
“Then listen well, Gu Wang, for now… I shall show you the truth—not only with my words, but with action. ”

All of a sudden, Fang Yuan’s voice trembles as he begins, each word heavy with sorrow, as if the weight of the story was crushing him from within. His eyes glisten with unshed tears, and his hands shake slightly, gripping the edges of his seat as though trying to steady himself against the storm of emotions threatening to overwhelm him. He pauses for a moment, drawing in a shaky breath, before continuing.

---

"Deep within a boundless mountain forest," Fang Yuan whispers, his voice quivering like a fragile thread on the verge of snapping, "the sunlight weaved golden patterns through the leaves... but beneath those shimmering rays lurked a demon—an ancient being cursed by eternity, trapped in a young body." He pauses again, swallowing hard, his throat constricting as if even speaking these words caused him unbearable pain.

"Love? Kindness?" Fang Yuan's voice breaks, filled with regret and anguish. "Those were foolish notions long abandoned by him. Now, all he sought was immortality—a selfish pursuit that left no room for compassion or mercy." His tone grows darker, colder, yet tinged with an undercurrent of despair, as though mourning the loss of humanity itself.

"That day," Fang Yuan continues, his voice trembling with suppressed emotion, "that demon needed a wild boar to feed his Gu worm—a parasite that demanded constant nourishment. Hours passed, and fortune mocked him cruelly." His breathing hitched, and for a moment, it seemed as though he might break down completely.

"The vast mountain stretched endlessly, yet no beast crossed his path!" Fang Yuan's voice rose suddenly, raw and broken, filled with the frustration and anger of the demon himself. "It feels like everyone is cursing him! The universe itself seemed determined to deny him!"

Then, just as quickly, his voice softened, almost faltering, as he described the moment when fate intervened. "Suddenly, that demon sees a wild boar caught in a trap. That demon quickly killed that wild boar to steal it..." His voice trailed off, choked with emotion, before regaining strength. "But before the demon could claim his prize, four hunters burst forth from the trees."

One of them shouted, "'Hey! That’s our boar! How dare you steal our hunt! Who do you think you are?!'" Fang Yuan mimics their voices now, loud and defiant, but his own voice wavers, unable to fully mask the sorrow beneath.

"That demon was very cruel," Fang Yuan says, his voice dropping to a near whisper, trembling with disgust and grief. "Without saying anything, he unexpectedly shoots a blade..." His breath hitched, and tears spilled down his cheeks as he forced himself to continue. "...and one of them loses their hand."

He takes a shaky breath, steadying himself. "The leader, well-built and brave, stepped forward, ordering that demon to stop right there. 'I won’t let you harm us!' he shouted. 'I’ll face you myself! DIE!'"

Fang Yuan's voice grows strained, cracking under the weight of what came next. "That demon was trapped in a weak and young body, but he was experienced—merciless. The boy fought bravely, desperately... but it wasn’t enough." His voice broke entirely here, and he covered his face with one hand, shaking his head as if trying to shake away the image. After a moment, he composed himself, though his voice remained thick with emotion.

"That demon killed him after some hardship."

Fang Yuan’s voice grew quieter, heavier, as he recounted the aftermath. "That demon was so cruel that he ordered the other hunters to carry the boy’s body back to his home. In a secluded house in the mountains, a beautiful girl was fetching water, helping her old father. She was pure, innocent, gentle, loving, caring—full of life. Her laughter had once echoed through the forest, bringing warmth to all who heard it. But now, her world was about to shatter."

"Suddenly, that demon comes mercilessly," Fang Yuan continued, his voice shaking with rage and sorrow. "He throws the corpse forward and shouts, 'Are you Old Man Wang? Your son offended me. I have executed him.'"

His voice softened, trembling with empathy for the old man. "'This old man pays his respects to Lord Gu Master! Forgive my insolence!'" Fang Yuan mimicked the old man’s plea, his voice breaking with the weight of the desperation behind the words.

"Seeing her brother dead, that young, pure, innocent, gentle, loving, caring girl threw away the basket of water she had been fetching. She ran toward her brother’s corpse, screaming, 'Why did you do it?!'" Fang Yuan’s voice cracked, overcome by the injustice of it all. Tears streamed freely down his face now, unchecked, as he relived the tragedy.

"And then," he whispered, his voice barely audible, "she rushed to attack that demon. But in the way, that old man shouted and bit into her arm, holding her back. 'You’ve lost your brother,' he cried. 'Do you want to lose your father too?'"

Fang Yuan paused, clutching his chest as if the pain of the girl’s loss were his own. "That girl—pure, innocent, gentle, loving, caring—started crying, holding her brother’s corpse. She couldn’t understand what she should do. Her world was crumbling around her. And then... then..." His voice broke again, and he buried his face in his hands for a moment, sobbing quietly.

When he finally spoke again, his voice was hollow, drained of everything except profound sorrow. "That demon ordered the old man to create a map of the mountain. With trembling hands, he created the map and handed it to the demon. But the demon saw through the deception immediately. Without hesitation, he killed the old man with a shot of his blade."

Fang Yuan’s voice rose, trembling with fury and heartbreak. "That young, innocent, gentle, pure, cheerful, helpful, loving, caring girl fell into despair. She had just lost her brother, and now, before her very eyes, her father also died. They were her only family. She loved them more than anything in this world. She couldn’t comprehend how such cruelty could exist."

He paused, gasping for air, his entire body shaking with the effort of holding back sobs. "Her heart burned with righteous fury. She had no weapon. She didn’t know how to fight. She was too innocent, too pure. But she charged forward anyway because she had already lost everyone she loved. She didn’t care about her life anymore."

Fang Yuan’s voice dropped to a whisper, trembling with disbelief and sorrow. "That demon knew that this young and innocent lady couldn’t harm him, even if she charged. But that demon... he had no love, no humanity, no mercy. Too cruel. He shot a blade toward that girl even before she could reach him."

Fang Yuan’s voice cracked completely now, and he let out a strangled sob. "And then... she died. In the hands of that cruel demon."

The room was silent except for the sound of Fang Yuan’s ragged breathing and quiet sobs. He sat there, broken, as if bearing the weight of every tear shed by the listeners who mourned alongside him.
