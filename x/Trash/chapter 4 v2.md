Over a hundred 15 year-old youths gathered in front of the clan pavilion. The clan pavilion is in the middle of the village. A elder shouts, "Today is the awakening ceremony and it is your life's great turning point. I won't say much, just come with me. And don't make any noise as the clan leader along with all the important elder will be present." Then he leads the young teenagers into the pavilion. However they don't go up, but are led downstairs after going through the entrance great hall. Following down a constructed stone ladder, they went into an underground cave.

In the underground cave, there is a small river flowing gently. The river is covered with flowers of all colors. The walls and floor of the cave are covered with bright, colorful stones which are shining like small pieces of treasure. The light in the cave makes the stones sparkle and reflect in the water, making it look magical.

All the youths becomes astonished seeing all these things and starts chatting slowly with amazement. The elder orders them to keep quite. Gu Xianer is observing everything quietly with amazement. Suddenly, She becomes very excited seeing fishes dancing in the river alone with colorful flowers and shouts, "Look brother, fishes are dancing in the river."
Fang Yuan was also astonished seeing all these things. But he quickly grabs Gu Xianer and stops her from talking anything farther. But everyone along with clan elders are looking at Gu Xianer as if she has done a grave mistake which makes her frightened. Fang Yuan quickly apologizes to everyone by bowing his head. At the same time, Fang Yuan gently wraps his fingers around hers, squeezing lightly as if saying, "Don't worry. I am here." Gu Xianer wraps both her hands tightly around Fang Yuan's arm, her head leaning lightly against it, her grip firm and trembling as if his strength could chase away all her fears. After the situation becomes normal, Fang Yuan looks into Gu Xianer's trembling eyes, his gaze firm yet gentle, silently saying, "Don’t be afraid. Your brother is here."










The elder shouts, "Alright, listen as I call your names. Those who are called must walk through this river to the opposite bank. Walk as far as you can. The further you go the batter your talent is for cultivation. "

Then clan elder then shouts a name. Hearing his name, this youth steps into the river of flower. The river is wide but not deep. It only covers up to the youth's kneecaps. He feels an invisible pressure as if there is a wall in front of him that he can't see which is blocking him from walking forward. During this moment, the flowers at his feet suddenly gives of a weak white light. The light gathered around Chen Bo and enters his body. For a moment, he feels the pressure has dropped. The invisible wall blocking him suddenly feels softer. He tries to force himself walk further but after taking total 3 steps, he can't walk any further.

The elder sighs a deep sigh and shouts only 3 steps, no talent to become a Gu Master. Then he shouts the next name.

The next boy starts walking in the river of flower. He forces himself as hard as he can but only takes 9 steps. Seeing this, the elder shouts, only 9 steps, no talent of cultivation.

This process continues. Some takes 10-19 steps which makes them D-grade talent. Some takes 20-29 steps which makes them C-grade talent.

Then the elder shouts, "[[Gu Yue Mo Bei]]." He starts walking through the river of flower. He takes total 36 steeps and then no longer walk any further.

The youths at the riverbank watch with wide opened eyes, shocked. The academy elder happily exclaimed, "Good, Gu Yue Mo Bei, B grade talent!"

Seeing this boy, Fang Zheng gives a devilish smile while pondering in his mind, "Mo Bai, he is the successor of Mo Faction which is one of the most powerful factions in [[Gu Yue clan]]. I think she has a sister. His sister is crucial for my plan. I will use him to get close to his grand grand father, who is the leader of Mo Faction. Afterward, his sister will be my target. In this way, this whole Mo Faction will dance under my palm. he he he."

Seeing his laughter growing louder, Fang Yuan taps him and whispers, "Fang Zheng, don't make any noise. The elder would get mad at us."

At this moment, the academy elder shouts, "[[Gu Yue Chi Chen]]!" As he walks onto the opposite bank, the little lights enters his body. After walking straight for 36 steps, he stops.

Seeing this, the elder shouts with excitement, "Another B grader talent!"

Seeing Chi Chen, Fang Zheng ponders in his mind, "Chi Chen! Chi Chen! You will be my key to control you Chi Faction. he he he. Because I know your talent is only a C grader but your grandfather uses some method on you which allows you to walk only 36 steps. Ha ha ha. Your Chi Faction is already under my palm."





This process continues, after a few moments, the clan elder shouts, "Gu Yue Fang Zheng!"
Hearing Fang Zheng's name, Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer become extremely nervous. Gu Xianer says, "Fang Zheng, I know you will have high grade talent." Fang Yuan says, "Don't be nervous. Stay confident. We must have high grade talents."

Fang Zheng doesn't pay any attention to their words and confidently starts walking through the river. Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer look very frightened as they are continuously praying for Fang Zheng. Within a moment he reaches the opposite bank of the river. 

The elder shouts with excitement, "43 steps! A grade talent!"

Everyone becomes amazed. Gu Xianer jumps into Fang Yuan's arms and shouts with excitement, "Brother, haven't I told you that we will be high grade talent! Look at Fang Zheng! He is a A grade talent." Fang Yuan also hugs her tightly as if all the dream that he has been dreaming has suddenly come true. Their future is going to be very good and with only success, happiness.

The head of Chi Faction declares, "We will adopt him and raise him." The head of the Mo Faction shouts, "You are not capable, We will take him." The clan head shouts, "No one is qualified except me."





After sometime, the clan head shouts, "Gu Yue Fang Yuan." Gu Xianer shouts with excitement, "Brother, it is your turn. You will do even better than little brother."

Fang Yuan nervously starts taking his steps in the river of flower. He feels immense pressure. After taking 15 steps, he can't take a single step. He tries his hard. After trying very hard, he can barely make 17 steps. After ward, the primeval aperture automatically forms which means even if he takes more steps, it would have no effect as the primeval aperture has already been created.

Fang Yuan sinks to the ground, disappointment weighing heavily on him. Without realizing it, tears begin to stream from his eyes. It feels as though, for one fleeting moment, he saw all his dreams come true—only to suddenly realize they were never his dreams at all. He was merely a side character in someone else’s story. All his hopes now serve as fuel, feeding the flames of his despair.

Seeing this, Fang Zheng smiles in his heart while pondering, "Ha ha ha. Not even a C grade that I had given him. Only a D grade trash. Now it will be a good entertainment to see you, Fang Yuan in despair. Ha ha ha. I will make you feel even more despair that I had to face for creating you. he he he. Don't worry. You will not have to face this despair for too long as I have already made a proper plan of using you as my nourishment."

The clan elders shouts with disappointment, "Gu Yue Fang Yuan, only 17 steps and only a D-grade talent."

The clan elder shouts, "Fang Yuan, Don't sit there." 

Fang Yuan snaps out of his feeling and quickly returns while trying to show himself tough. While returning, he prays in his heart, "I hope my little sister becomes the most talented. I can bear my failure and suffer but I can't bear seeing her suffer even more."

While Fang Yuan is returning showing himself tough, he hears other saying: "They look the same but one is the Dragon and other is a small snake." "Ha ha ha, Fate is really cruel." "Seeing him, I feel relief from my pain" "I heard his little sister is nothing more than a low intelligent pig. Let’s hope she doesn’t end up having even this much talent." 

Fang Yuan pretends to be emotionless in this situation but he starts crying when he see his sister crying and rubbing her eyes. Without a word, they embrace each other. Tears are flowing like stream while no visible sound. Gu Xianer subconsciously ponders while tears are flowing, "My brother is only a D grade talent. I don't want any talent form this cruel world. I just want to make my brother happy. If I have no talent for cultivation, I could say my brother that he has at least D grade talent for cultivation but I haven't any. In this way, he will feel less pain." From the bottom of her heart, she starts rejecting hope without her knowing. She hasn't even think any of these in reality, it was all her subconscious act and decision.

Suddenly, the clan elder shouts, "Next, Gu Yue Gu Xianer."

Fang Yuan says , "Go, Gu Xianer. You will have high talent."

Without uttering a word, she steps into the river of flowers. Her face carries an expression beyond the grasp of words—not one of despair, but of something far more profound. She doesn't look like someone who has surrendered to hopelessness; rather, she seems to have rejected it entirely, despising the very existence of it.

A miraculous scene occurs before everyone. Gu Xianer walks through the river but isn't facing any resistance. And even more, all the Hope Gu is making path for Gu Xianer. It is as if all the Hope Gu worms are afraid of Gu Xianer. She reaches the opposite bank of the river. Even more she reach the very end but nothing happens. It is as if she is just walking through a normal road.

The elders start talking to themselves: "Why there is no Hope Gu around her?" "It is as if the Hope Gu is avoiding her." "It looks like she has no hope in her heart."

The academy elder calls Gu Xianer and then checks her aptitude and talent. Then he declares, "Gu Xianer. No talent."

Gu Xianer returns to Fang Yuan with a happy smile. She stands before him and says, "Look brother, you have at least have talent for cultivation but I have no talent. So, you don't have to be sad."

Fang Yuan quickly embraces Gu Xianer and shouts while crying, "How can fate be this much unfair! If fate is this much cruel to my sister, then I despise fate. Don't worry Xianer. You brother will find a way to make you the most talented! We will become high and mighty immortal without having talent."

Gu Xianer tightens her embrace and responds crying, "Yes, brother. We will become immortal. We will become most talented by our hard work. We will never relay on fate anymore."

Seeing their situation, Fang Zheng ponders, "It is even more refreshing than I have anticipated. Seeing you two in this situation, really making me happy. It would be good for my plan if Gu Xianer had high grade talent."

Suddenly, a miraculous scene happen. All the Hope Gu rushes towards Gu Xianer without her knowing. She is still embracing Fang Yuan. Everyone becomes shocked. After a few moments, Gu Xianer gets her aperture. Academy elder quickly rushes towards Gu Xianer to check. After checking, He declares with shocked all over his face, "Gu Xianer, 100% talent! Above A grade!"

With a burst of pure joy, Fang Yuan takes Gu Xianer up in his arms, lifting her effortlessly  as his heart swelling with pride. His face breaks into a wide, radiant smile, his eyes sparkling with uncontainable happiness. Without a second thought, he spins her around in the air, laughing aloud as the world seems to disappear around them.

"I knew it! I knew It!" he exclaims, his voice full of amazement and joy. As he spins her, he feels as if the weight of the world lifts off his shoulders, replaced by the warmth of her success. She also starts laughing with pure joy as she sees his brother happy. Their laughter fill the air, as they both revel in the pure, unspoken bond of the moment.

This is the happiest moment in Fang Yuan's both life. He has never felt this much joy and warmth in his entire both life. There is a saying: "Your own success brings pride and joy, but witnessing the success of someone you deeply love fills your heart with a warmth and happiness that no personal achievement could ever match."

Fang Zheng is also laughing with Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer. It feels like the bond between the siblings is pure and can never be severed. But while laughing with them, Fang Zheng ponders in his mind, "It is really a good news. ha ha ha. I was regretting thinking Gu Xianer has no talent as she is very important for my plan. Now, it looks like even the heaven is on my side. Tonight, I will revise my future plan. he he he."
