“What is going on? I have been observing character/-/Fang Yuan for about a month since I have come to this world. He looks so innocent. He has even cried and felt despair when he found out that he is only a D-grade. Again, I can clearly recall that I gave Fang Yuan a C-grade aptitude, but here he is only a D-grade and he has taken only 17 steps. That is quite confusing. It is really frustrating.” Fang Zheng murmurs to himself in his room. 

After seeing Fang Yuan is only a D grade talent and is crying, Gu Xianer feels extreme sorrow. She tries to comfort him by saying many things. She also starts crying with Fang Yuan. Gu Xianer says, "Brother, it may be wrong. We should check again.” Everyone starts rediculing Fang Yuan. Saying many bad things, calling him a trash. Which makes gu xianer and fang yuan even more sad. Suddenly, Clan elder shouts gu xianer, but she doesn’t respond. Fang Yuan tells her to go and check her talent. Gu Xianer doesn’t even think about her talent. Gu Xianer thinks what the work of talent is if my brother is only a D-grade talent. I don’t want any talent. Gu Xianer starts walking through the flower river while crying and thinking, “If this world gives my brother only a d-grade talent that I don’t want any talent.” Without her knowing, she has completely passed through the river. But nothing happened to her. Clan elder becomes stupified seeing there is no Hope Gu warm around her even though she has completely passed through the river. After checking Gu Xianer, Clan elder shouts, absolutely no talent, with a startled expression because everyone has some talents, even if it is too little to detect. But Gu Xianer has no talent because not a single hope Gu warm were around her. 

After coming back to Fang Yuan, Gu Xianer says with a smile, 'Brother, look, you have at least some talent, but I don’t have any talent. You are still better.”

Seeing this, Fang Yuan hugs Gu Xianer and says while crying, “It is not true; you have talents. Don’t worry; your brother will find a way to give you talent. Even if you don’t have any talent, you would become a Gu master; no, you would become a high and mighty immortal. I believe in you.” Suddenly, all the hope Gu worms from the river of flowers rush at Gu Xianer, and she opens her aperture, which makes everyone confused.

Clan Elder quickly rushes to Gu Xianer and becomes stupified seeing her 100% aperture.

He is lying on the bed, but there is no sleep in his eyes. He looks extremely frustrated, and then suddenly he wakes up from his bed and then shouts in his heart, "Why do I have a little sister? I don’t recall writing anything like this. Fang Zheng’s mother has given birth to three children at the same time. But I have written that she would give birth to Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng. I had never written like this.”

Suddenly thinking something, he freezes and jumps down from his bed. “Wait! Wait! This is not the reborn Fang Yuan but the original Fang Yuan with no experiences. Now that I think about it, this is his first life where he will face difficulty, and then after extreme hardship after 600 years, he will refine Spring Autumn Cicada.”

“Maybe Heaven’s will has created my little sister to prevent me from accomplishing my goal. Now my primary enemies are my big brother and my little sister. That means all the major events will be happened by me, not Fang Yuan.”

Suddenly, with a devious and wicked smile, Fang Zheng shouts with extreme excitement, “Fang Yuan, I will make you suffer with my own hand, and then I will kill you. For you, I have to starve to death. For you, my wife left me. For you, my naibers avoided me. For you, my other works, where I put even more efforts to create, were put aside. Even my children, whom I loved so much, left me. My wife, whom I gave away all my incomes, left me. Even when I was in bed waiting to die, there was no one. Even when I called everyone, they made lame excuses. My wife, my children, my sister, my brother, and even my parents didn’t come to see me. I had told them that this is just a fictional character. It has nothing to do with reality. I even told them that it had nothing to do with my characters. They didn’t want to hear me. Even after hearing they told me I should not create something like this. Everyone scolded me, ostracized me, hated me.”

“I can still recall clearly when I had no money and I was alone. But suddenly a random fan of yours gave me some donations and advised me that my new novels were not that great and I should make them more like Fang Yuan. Even though I had put much effort into them, they had never appreciated my other works. They had never appreciated my work at all. They actually appreciate you, Fang Yuan. Even when I tried to convince them, they stood before me, showing many logics. I had to abandon all of my hard work just for you, Fang Yuan. I really hate you. I really hate myself for creating you. You are my greatest regret. Even when I was dying before reincarnating, I cursed you.”

Then, making a devilish face, Fang Zheng shouts while looking at the moon through the windows, “Now it is my opportunity. Ha ha ha... I think Haven has given me this opportunity to take my revenge on you, Fang Yuan. Now I will take all the opportunities. I will manipulate you and also do some charity on the surface to help you, but in reality, I will make you feel what is true despair, poverty, and frustration. And even after that, I will make you dead without your knowing. Ha ha haaa…”

"Tonight I will create a plan. You love your little sister so much. Then, I will start snatching her from you, and I will also make her hate you. I will manipulate her in a way so that she will kill you. On serface, I will always be on your side. I will always pretend to be a good little brother who always sacrifices his own benefits to help his big brother. He he he. No matter how intelligent you are, you are just a creation of mine, while I am the creator. Ha ha ha.” His devilish laughter shakes the room where there is no light; only the moonlight’s light creates a dim reflection, which makes it even more eerie.

At the same time, in another room, “Brother, don’t be sad. I, Gu Xianer, will always be with you. I will protect you. I will punish them who will speak ill of you.” “I am not unhappy. You don’t need to worry about me. Now, my precious princess, please sleep. I have already told you a story.” 

Suddenly Gu Xianer hugs Fang Yuan and says, “Brother, tomorrow, I will beat all of them who will make you sad. From now on, I will protect you from these bad people. You have been protecting me now. It is my time.” With a gentle smile while pinching her cheek, Fang Yuan says, “Then I will depend on you from now on, My Little Princess. I have already told you thousands of times that you should not hug me. You should understand that there is a difference between a boy and a girl. You should understand these differences. I have you to sleep in Fang Zheng’s room alone while I and Fang Zheng will sleep in my room. But you cry every time, saying you are afraid and you will only sleep with me. And you do not allow anyone to sleep with us either.” 

With an angry and annoyed tone, Gu Xianer crawls to another side and makes some distance and then looks to the opposite side and shouts, “I hate you, big brother. I hate you. I will never talk to you. I will never look at you. I will never worry about you. Even I will not protect you from these bad people.”

After some time, 

Fang Yuan checks Gu Xianer and then walks towards the windows. Suddenly his lovely, innocent, and gentle eyes change into an endless abyss. Looking at the moon in the sky, Fang Yuan asks, “It is not an illusion. How long are you planning to hide?” 

In his mind, a man who looks just like Fang Yuan, whose eyes are also cold just like him, comes out from endless darkness and responds with the same tone as if they are the same and there is no difference: “You have found me out. As expected from you.” 

“Who are you? I was refining the blackhole that I had absorbed but suddenly came back millions of years past in time when I hadn’t even started my journey.”

“Who knows who I am? I may be you, or you may be I. I may be your enemy or maybe your friend. Who knows? Who I am? You will find all your answers within this boy.”

“This boy is not me, and this girl is also not my sister either. I had never had any sisters. But I can feel that we had some kind of strong connection that can never be erased, but I can’t tell what exactly it is!”

“You are really the best. You have been plotting against me and probing me for the last 6 months. Even now you are plotting against me. I like it.”

“So you can read my mind easily. It looks like I am an open book before you.”

“He he he, You have grabbed it quickly. You have already found out how your personalities change and work, don’t you, Logical Fang Yuan?”

“So, I am Logical Fang Yuan! Then what should I call you?”

“You can call me Administrator Fang Yuan. And you can call this innocence of yours Illogical Fang Yuan.”

“So, that means this middle one should be Balanced Fang Yuan.”

“Now, let me see how you will manipulate other personalities of yours and execute your plan. Don’t exclude me from your plan. I could use my power. I don't mind providing you a little help if you could make me excited.” 

Logical Fang Yuan doesn’t respond. He looks at the moon with his indifferent and eerie eyes. The reflection of the dim light of the moon falling on Fang Yuan’s face makes it eerie and frightening.
