As they step into the bustling market, the air crackles with an almost electric ferocity —vendors shouting their wares like war cries that echo through the narrow alleys, customers haggling with a ferocious intensity that feels primal, as if lives are at stake. The thick aroma of sizzling street food and fresh produce hangs heavy in the atmosphere, mingling with sweat and desperation, creating a heady cocktail of chaos. Stalls overflow with a kaleidoscope of goods: ripe fruits glisten under the sun as though coated in liquid gold, delicate trinkets shimmer with intricate craftsmanship so fine it seems otherworldly.

Fang Yuan strides forward, each step radiating an arrogant ease, his presence commanding attention like a storm cloud rolling over a quiet village. Behind him trail Gu Xianer, Gu Wang, and Yao Le, their soft chatter weaving through the cacophony like a fragile melody against the market’s thunderous symphony—a whisper drowned out by roaring waves.

Then—

“MY ANGELIC, CUTE, ADORABLE, LITTLE XIANER!”

Fang Yuan’s voice explodes through the market like a detonation, silencing every conversation mid-sentence, freezing vendors mid-shout, turning heads in unison as though some invisible force had yanked them all into alignment. With a sudden, theatrical flourish, he spins on his heel, pointing at Gu Xianer with dramatic precision, his face contorted into an exaggerated seriousness, as though delivering a divine proclamation meant to reshape the very fabric of reality itself.

“Do you remember how I taught you to determine the right price for vegetables and goods?” His tone is commanding yet playful, laced with the weight of someone imparting sacred wisdom carved into stone tablets from the heavens.

Gu Xianer’s eyes sparkle, her lips parting in excitement as she claps her hands together. “Yes! I must watch others buy the same things I want! By observing them, I can learn the right price!”

Fang Yuan nods approvingly, but then—his smile sharpens, his eyes gleam with predatory mischief. “Good, but do you recall any other method?”

Gu Xianer’s excitement falters. She frowns, tilting her head, her brow furrowing in deep thought. Seconds stretch into eternity. Finally, she shakes her head, frustration scrunching up her features. “I don’t remember…”

Fang Yuan’s gaze shifts. Slowly. Deliberately.

It lands on Yao Le.

Under his piercing stare, Yao Le stiffens. A deep crimson floods her cheeks, and she hurriedly looks away, her voice trembling, barely audible. “I—I don’t know,” she stammers, clutching her sleeves tightly. “My grandma always buys what I need…”

Fang Yuan exhales a long, theatrical sigh , shaking his head in an exaggerated display of despair. His entire body seems to sag under the weight of disappointment, as if the universe itself had failed him. Then—his eyes gleam. His lips curl.

His gaze lands on Gu Wang.

“You should know, shouldn’t you?” His voice turns slow, honeyed, dripping with mock affection. Then, without a shred of shame, he beams at her and declares,

“My loving, cute, eternal maid~”

The words hit like a nuclear blast.

Gu Wang freezes. Every muscle in her body locks up as the sheer absurdity and humiliation of those words slam into her like a freight train hurtling off its tracks. Blood rushes to her face, turning her complexion an impossible shade of scarlet, as if her skin might burst into flames. Her ears burn. Her hands clench into trembling fists, shaking with barely contained fury, veins throbbing visibly beneath her skin.

Yao Le, too, turns bright pink, her expression torn between wide-eyed shock and utter mortification, her fingers twisting nervously around the hem of her dress.

Only Gu Xianer remains unaffected, tilting her head in pure curiosity, completely unfazed by Fang Yuan’s ridiculous declaration. Instead, she remains focused on his question, blinking innocently, oblivious to the emotional earthquake unfolding around her.

Gu Wang’s breath comes in short, furious gasps. Her body trembles—not with fear, but with a burning, volcanic rage that threatens to consume everything in its path. Her hands twitch at her sides, as if fighting the overwhelming urge to strangle him on the spot, to silence this maddening creature who has somehow wormed his way into her life and refuses to leave.

And then—

"PLEASE, STOP ACTING LIKE THIS IN PUBLIC!" she shrieks, her voice trembling with desperation and cracking under the weight of her emotions. "YOU'RE GOING TO KILL US WITH THIS BEHAVIOR! YOU'RE EMBARRASSING US! YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF! LOOK AT THEM! LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING! EVERYONE IS STARING!"

At her outburst, Fang Yuan finally deigns to glance around.

A crowd has gathered—a sea of young men, their faces twisted in a mixture of awe, bitterness, and boiling envy. Their eyes lock onto Fang Yuan, their expressions flickering between admiration and absolute, unrestrained hatred, their clenched fists betraying the turmoil brewing within.

Fang Yuan pauses.

Then—

A slow, wicked grin spreads across his face, his eyes gleaming with a dangerous, intoxicating amusement. His voice rises—bold, unrestrained, dripping with mockery while looking at the people around him.

“LOOK AT YOU! LOOK AT YOURSELVES! TRULY, A SIGHT SO PITIFUL, SO PATHETIC, I ALMOST FEEL SORRY FOR YOU!”

His voice booms across the market, slicing through the noise like a blade cutting through silk. It pierces the ears of everyone present, forcing them to confront the truth—or rather, the lie—they’ve been living.

The crowd flinches. Some take an involuntary step back, startled by his sheer audacity. Others glare, their faces twisting in outrage, humiliation burning in their eyes like wildfire.

But Fang Yuan isn’t done.

He steps forward, his movements deliberate, calculated, as if he were a predator circling its prey. His gaze sweeps across their faces—sneering, condescending, as if looking at a collection of lowly, unworthy vermin.

“All of you, look at yourself, you stand there, wide-eyed, slack-jawed, drooling like starving dogs at a feast you’ll never taste! You glare at me, your fists trembling, your teeth grinding, but what can you do? NOTHING. Because deep down, you know I speak the truth.”

He laughs—a loud, scornful, merciless laugh, echoing through the marketplace like a whip cracking against their pride.

“Look at me! LOOK AT ME! I walk with three celestial angels, three radiant goddesses who shine brighter than the sun itself! And you—YOU —are nothing but filthy, lowly peasants, drowning in your own envy, rotting in your own loneliness, your very existence a monument to failure!”

He laughs.

Loud. Arrogant. Triumphant.

A laugh dripping with utter contempt, a laugh that sears their very souls, leaving behind scars that will never fully heal.

“Look at me! I walk with three beautiful angels, while you—you lowly, worthless, unloved peasants —can only watch from the shadows like the wretched filth you are! Ha! You aren’t even WORTHY! ”

The reaction is instant.

The young men in the crowd twitch, some trembling with barely contained rage. Their faces burn with a humiliation so intense they can taste the bitterness in their throats, acidic and suffocating.

But Fang Yuan isn’t done.

He stretches out his arms, as if basking in divine glory, his chest puffed out like a peacock displaying its feathers. His voice booms, dripping with theatrical arrogance, each word landing like a hammer blow to their already shattered egos.

“AH! WHAT A WONDERFUL LIFE I LIVE! How tragic it must be—to be you! To wake up each morning and realize you are destined for nothing! To spend your days lurking in the shadows, watching men like me THRIVE while you wallow in mediocrity!”

His grin widens, his tone turning sharper, crueler, cutting deeper than any blade ever could.

“You wish you were me, don’t you? You’d sell your soul for a single glance from a woman like mine! But alas! Not even the gods would pity you! Even if you begged, even if you crawled on your hands and knees, even if you threw yourselves into the dirt at my feet—you would remain worthless. ”

The market is dead silent.

Some men clench their fists so tight their knuckles turn white, their bodies trembling with shame. Others stare at the ground, too humiliated to meet anyone’s gaze. A few look like they might actually vomit from sheer disgrace, their faces pale, their stomachs churning violently.

A handful of girls giggle, whispering among themselves, utterly entertained by Fang Yuan’s relentless humiliation of the crowd. Some cast intrigued glances at him, undeniably captivated by his presence, their hearts racing despite themselves.

And then—Fang Yuan delivers the final blow.

He exhales, shaking his head, his face twisting in an exaggerated look of pity, his voice dropping to a near-whisper that somehow carries across the entire market.

“Truly, it must be suffering beyond words… To live life as you. ”

The crowd erupts.

Gu Xianer, as usual, only blinks in innocent curiosity. She tilts her head and asks sincerely, “Brother, are they really that pitiful?”

Yao Le, meanwhile, covers her face with both hands, completely devoured by secondhand embarrassment. Her whole body trembles from the sheer absurdity of what just happened. “I—I can’t believe he actually said that out loud…” she mumbles, praying for the ground to swallow her whole.

But the worst reaction belongs to—

Gu Wang.

Her face is so red it could explode. Her hands tremble violently, her nails digging crescent moons into her palms. Her breath is ragged, her chest rising and falling rapidly, as though she’s struggling to breathe through the suffocating weight of humiliation. Her entire body is locked in place, as if on the verge of detonating, her fury bubbling over like molten lava threatening to consume everything in its path.

And then—he goes even further.

“Look at you all, you lowly insects. Do you know how much I’m going to enjoy my time with these three celestial angels? Do you know what it's like to be bathed in their light while you rot in the darkness? Ahh, how fortunate I am! And you—you aren’t even worth the dirt beneath their feet.”

Gu Xianer’s eyes light up from Fang Yuan’s performance. She claps enthusiastically, her face beaming with admiration, utterly unaware of the chaos swirling around her.

“Brother is really cool! ”

Meanwhile, Gu Wang and Yao Le desperately try to hide their faces, shaking, utterly consumed by the unrelenting, merciless embarrassment that is Fang Yuan.

Gu Wang’s jaw clenches so hard it feels like her teeth might shatter. Her fists tighten until her arms shake, her mind racing with thoughts of revenge—visions of throttling Fang Yuan, of dragging him through the mud, of making him pay for this public spectacle. But she knows better. She knows that no matter what she does, he’ll always find a way to twist it, to turn it back on her, to make her feel even smaller than before.

And as the crowd begins to disperse, muttering curses under their breath, shooting daggers with their eyes, Fang Yuan stands tall, basking in the aftermath of his destruction. He turns to Gu Xianer, his expression softening instantly, his voice filled with genuine affection.

“Come, my sweet sister. Let’s continue our shopping. These peasants bore me.”

Gu Xianer giggles, skipping after him without a care in the world, while Gu Wang and Yao Le trail behind, their faces still burning with humiliation, their minds replaying every excruciating moment of Fang Yuan’s merciless tirade.


Just as Fang Yuan and his group are about to leave, a group of Gu Masters steps forward, blocking their path. The leader, a middle-aged man with a rough, weathered face and a scar running down his cheek, glares at Fang Yuan and shouts,

“You’ve got quite the courage, you brat!”
