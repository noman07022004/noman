Fang Yuan lies motionless on the bed, his condition unchanged, as if teetering between life and death. His breaths are shallow, his broken body unnervingly still, as if he has long since departed from the realm of the living, leaving only a husk behind. The dim glow of the lantern flickers against his deathly pale face, illuminating the gruesome wounds that stretch across his battered form. His skin is cracked, his flesh torn, his bones jutting out in unnatural angles—as if the very fabric of his being has been unmade by some cruel force.

Gu Wang kneels beside him, her hands steady despite the overwhelming horror before her. She applies medicine with careful precision, her fingers gentle as she tends to his wounds, as if afraid that even the slightest pressure will shatter him completely. The smell of herbs and blood mixes in the air, thick and suffocating, yet she does not waver.

Beside her, Gu Xianer trembles uncontrollably. Her tiny hands, still stained with the dried blood of countless men, assist with bandaging his wounds, but they shake so violently that the fabric nearly slips from her grip. Her lips move without pause, an endless whisper of desperation. "Please don't die... please don't die... please don't die..." Her voice is raw, hoarse from all the screaming, all the crying. She clings to Fang Yuan's ruined body as if her sheer will alone can anchor him to life.

Gu Wang watches her carefully, absorbing everything. Unlike her father and brother, she does not fear Gu Xianer. Rather, her heart aches for her. The girl looks barely human—her clothes are almost entirely gone, shredded beyond repair, leaving her draped in nothing but the blood that has soaked into every fiber of her being. The dark red has crusted over her skin, dyeing her hair, forming an eerie second layer of flesh that seems to replace what was lost.

Gu Wang studies her trembling form, her erratic mumblings, her overwhelming guilt, and draws her own conclusions.

"They are siblings," she thinks, connecting the dots from the desperate cries she has heard. "Just like me and Wang Er. This man must have gone through hell. No... they've both been through hell."

Her fingers hesitate slightly as she presses a fresh bandage against Fang Yuan's mangled chest. "From what she's mumbling, she blames herself. She keeps saying it was her fault. That if she hadn't insisted on leaving, this wouldn't have happened. That if she had just stayed put, let the bandits take her away, her brother wouldn't be like this."

Gu Wang's heart clenches painfully. "She... she must have suffered something horrible. She barely has any clothes left... and the way she is clinging to him, so desperate, so broken... Could it be... Could those monsters have—?"

Her stomach twists violently. Her hands pause for a brief moment before continuing the treatment.

"No... no, I shouldn't assume."

And yet, no matter how much she tells herself not to think about it, the image burns into her mind.

Gu Wang watches her, her heart breaking for Gu Xianer. She sees the terror lurking in Gu Xianer’s eyes, a darkness that goes far beyond the physical trauma. The girl’s clothes are ripped to shreds, offering scant protection. The blood isn’t just _on_ her; it’s _in_ her, staining her innocence, a permanent mark of the violation she has suffered. Gu Wang’s stomach twists with a sickening lurch. _Rape_. The word hangs unspoken in the air, a heavy, suffocating presence. The evidence is undeniable— in the torn fabric, the haunted look in Gu Xianer’s eyes, the way she flinches at the slightest touch.

"He fought for you," Gu Wang says softly, her voice thick with unshed tears. "He must have. He faced those… those animals… to protect you."

Gu Xianer’s breath hitched a ragged, broken sound. "So… many…" she whispered, trembling. "Attacked… us… together… Brother… took… all… blows… for me…" Her voice broke, a sob escaping her lips. "Thought… dead… Brother… gone…" She clutched at her torn clothes. "Then… me… Unconscious… Woke up… Thought… punishment… for… disobeying… giving up… All… my… fault… If… I… had… listened… all… my… fault… Don't… deserve… his… sister… He… was… too… good… to… me… I… was… always… burden…" Her voice was barely audible, thick with guilt and self-loathing. "Then… he came… saved me… but… too... much... wounded… too... much... wounded... wounded... beyond… even... my... recognization... All… my… fault… He’s… like… this… because… of… me…" 

The memories crashed down on her again, the pain and guilt intensifying, a fresh wave of agony washing over her. She tried to cry, to release the torrent of emotions trapped within her, but her tear ducts were dry, spent. A suffocating feeling gripped her chest, her breath coming in short, shallow gasps. The room began to spin, the lamplight flickering and blurring. And then, darkness. She slumped forward, unconscious. Even in her unconscious state, the lines of her face, and the slight tremor in her small frame, spoke volumes of the agony and guilt that still haunted her.

Everyone is so busy in their internal emotional turmoil and thinking that no one noticed her sudden fainting.

Gu Wang closes her eyes for a moment, horrific images flashing through her mind. The brutal assault, Gu Xianer’s terror, Fang Yuan’s desperate, valiant fight. _How many?_ she wonders, a chill creeping down her spine. _Five? Ten? More?_ She pictures him, smaller, weaker, yet fighting with the ferocity of a cornered beast, driven by an all-consuming need to save his sister. He has won, but the victory is pyrrhic.

Tears well up in her eyes, but she doesn't make a sound. She just lets them fall, silent streams of sorrow slipping down her cheeks as she continues dressing his wounds. Her shoulders tremble with the weight of her emotions, but she doesn't stop. She can't stop.

Wang Er and Old Man Wang are also trying to bandage and apply medicine, but their hands shake too violently. Every time they reach forward, a sharp, paralyzing fear grips them. What if they do it wrong? What if they make a mistake? What if... she gets angry for ...? The gruesome fate of the bandits is still fresh in their minds, and they cannot shake the image of her sitting amidst a sea of blood, as if she had orchestrated it all. They notices Gu Xianer's sudden faint. But they don't dare to look at Gu Xianer as if afraid that gazing at her will seal their fates. They dare not move, dare not breathe too loudly. The weight of what they believe has happened is too much to bear.

"She’s terrifying," Old Man Wang thinks, his fingers curling into his palms. "A monstrous Gu Master hidden in the form of a young girl. If we anger her, if we make even the smallest mistake... we won’t even have the luxury of a swift death."

Wang Er swallows hard beside him, his own thoughts running wild with fear and thinks in his mind, "She killed them all. She made them suffer beyond death. And she was covered in their blood. If she sees us as threats, we’re doomed. No... worse than doomed."

Gu Wang notices their trembling and thinks that they are trembling because they have carried Fang Yuan all the way. So, she takes the initiative and asks, "Step aside. You two are tired from carrying him." she murmurs, her voice quiet but firm. "I will do it."

Without their knowing, they automatically retreat from their internal fear , allowing her to take full control. They want to speak and say about the terrifying seen that they have witnessed, but their throats are too dry to form words. The fear has stolen even their voices.

Gu Wang continues tending to Fang Yuan, her delicate hands moving with care, her mind lost in sorrow.

Observing Gu Xianer's condition, Administrator Fang Yuan muses, "It seems I need to step in to help her. And…"

His eyes shift to Demonic Fang Yuan, who is merging with Naive Fang Yuan. "The process is almost complete. Soon, there will be no independent Demonic Fang Yuan or Naive Fang Yuan—only a new, unified self where they exist but are no longer separate. How fascinating. Ha ha ha."

After giving a pause, "[[Unpredictable Fang Yuan]]… That name fits perfectly. Ha ha ha. Looks like it's time to adjust the plan."

Gu Xianer lies motionless beside Fang Yuan, her tiny hands trembling as they clutch his limp, ruined fingers. Her body is still drenched in blood, her face pale, her breath shallow. Exhaustion claims her, dragging her into unconsciousness.

But rest does not bring peace.

The moment her eyes close, she is back in the cave.

The damp stone floor is cold beneath her. The laughter of the men echoes around her, vile and twisted. Their faces are obscured by the dim flickering torchlight, but their eyes—those hungry, predatory eyes—burn into her flesh.

Hands tear at her clothing. Rough fingers grip her wrists and force them apart. Someone yanks her hair, pulling her head back so she cannot move.

She thrashes, kicks, bites—anything to break free. But it is useless.

Laughter rings in her ears.

"Why are you in such a hurry?" one of them sneers. "Don't worry. After all your uncles give you some real pleasure, we'll send you to your brother."

She freezes.

**Brother…?**

Two men pin her arms to the ground. Another grips her head so tightly her skull feels like it will crack. The leader looms over her, his breath rancid, his hands reaching—

No.

**No.**

Her body goes cold.

She cannot fight.

She cannot escape.

She cannot even die.

**This is my punishment,** she tells herself. **I didn’t listen to my brother. I made him suffer. I deserve this.**

Her struggles fade. She stops resisting.

The men chuckle darkly.

"Now that’s a good girl," one of them taunts.

"Looks like she’s finally grown up," another sneers.

Just as the leader moves to claim her—

A shadow appears at the entrance.

A broken figure stands in the doorway.

The kidnappers turn. Their expressions shift from amusement to sheer disbelief.

"How the hell is he still alive?" someone breathes.

Fang Yuan steps forward.

His body is inhuman. Ruined beyond recognition. His skin is split, bones piercing through flesh. His skull is half exposed, chunks of his brain visible through gaping wounds. His organs dangle from his abdomen, sliding against the cave floor with every step.

Yet his face…

His face is the same.

Cold. Indifferent.

Dark eyes like an abyss, as if they could swallow the entire world.

The bandits tremble.

"Kill him!" their leader screams.

Weapons slice through the air.

Blades hack into his flesh.

An arm is severed. It falls to the ground with a wet thud.

He keeps walking.

Swords pierce his ribs. His organs spill onto the floor.

He keeps walking.

His legs are sliced off, his body collapsing.

He **crawls.**

Crawls toward Gu Xianer with unwavering resolve.

**Gu Xianer stares.**

Her mind is blank.

She cannot process what she is seeing.

He is dying. He should be dead. **He should be dead.**

Yet he comes for her.

He reaches her, blood pooling beneath him. His ruined hand cups her cheek, smearing her skin with warmth that is rapidly fading. His voice is soft—so, so soft.

"Don’t blame yourself."

Tears blur her vision.

"I chose this," he murmurs. "You are my precious sister. Even if I have to fight the whole world, I will fight for you."

His breath shudders.

"So be happy. You are my strength. If you give up… I will die. If you don’t give up… I will live."

His fingers tighten weakly.

"Hug me… as tightly as you can."

Her heart stops.

His words…

A blade flashes.

His head is severed.

Blood splashes across her face.

Fang Yuan’s head **rolls** across the stone floor.

Silence.

Nothing moves.

Nothing exists.

She **screams.**

She throws herself onto his broken corpse, arms wrapping around his lifeless body. His flesh is still warm, still familiar.

**No. No. No.**

This is not happening.

He told her not to give up.

He told her he would live.

She cannot let him die.

Through blurred vision, she sees his ruined body, and suddenly—

She remembers.

His lessons. His teachings. His guidance.

Her hands tremble as she presses her small frame against his. She closes her eyes, lets out a sob, and forces her primeval essence into him.

Nothing happens.

The bandits scoff.

"Pathetic," one mutters.

She sobs harder, her fingers digging into his flesh.

**Please.**

Her vision swims.

**Please, come back!**

Light flickers.

A pulse.

A tremor.

The bandits stiffen.

Fang Yuan’s body **shines.**

Flesh reforms. Muscles twist back into place. His organs slither back inside his body, stitching together as if time itself is reversing. Severed limbs snap back into place. His skull regrows, his eyes returning to their sockets, his skin sealing over fresh, untainted flesh.

Within moments—

Fang Yuan **breathes.**

Gu Xianer sobs.

He embraces her, pressing a soft kiss to her bloodstained forehead.

"Don’t worry," he whispers. "Your brother is here. Your brother will protect you."

The bandits collapse.

They **melt.**

Their screams are endless, their flesh peeling from their bones in slow, agonizing torment.

Gu Xianer does not look.

She clings to Fang Yuan.

But he smiles.

And then, before her eyes, **he melts, too.**

"Live a happy life without me," he murmurs.

**She screams again.**

---
Back to the reality.

"Brother!"

Gu Xianer bolts upright, her scream shattering the silence.

She is back.

The house is quiet. The air is still. The nightmare lingers in her mind, raw and real.

Gu Wang freezes, eyes wide as she watches the girl tremble. Gu Xianer’s entire body shakes, her breaths ragged, her hands clawing at the empty air.

"Brother… please don’t leave me…"

Tears stream down Gu Xianer’s cheeks.

She sobs, broken and inconsolable.

Gu Wang’s heart twists. She does not understand what horrors this girl has endured, but she knows despair when she sees it.

Without hesitation, she **embraces** Gu Xianer.

"It’s okay," she whispers, draping a cloth over her trembling shoulders. "You’re safe now."

Outside the room, Old Man Wang and Wang Er stand frozen.

Their hands tremble.

They do not pity Gu Xianer.

**They pity themselves.**

Because if Fang Yuan dies under their roof—

They know.

They **know.**

Their fate will be worse than the bandits’.

And just by that thought alone—

They cannot stop shaking.
