After sometime in uncle's room, [[Dong Tu|Fang Yuan's uncle]] shouts at Fang Yuan's aunt with anger, "Look, what have you done? Can't you even act gentle for 6 months. Ok, you don't have to act gentle for 6 months, how about three months. In this period we need to make them feel that we are their parents. Afterward, when we will ask them to become our children officially, they will become without any thought. After that you can act as you want. Even if you bit them, it doesn't matter. Because if they acknowledge us as their parents, then they will lose all their rights to inherit the inheritance. Now, have you understood the importance of acting gentle?"

Fang Yuan's aunt responds, "I was acting gentle all alone. And in the dining table, I have only criticized her for her incompetence. Was I wrong? Who will marry her if she can't even eat with her own hand properly?"

Fang Yuan's uncle responds, "I am not telling you that you are wrong. But the main problem is that Gu Xianer is brainless. Even though she is 15, the same age as Fang Yuan, she acts like a 3 years old child. And the main problem is Fang Yuan. He has spoiled her too much."

Fang Yuan's aunt nods with acknowledgment. "You are right. This Fang Yuan is the main reason behind everything. Even though he is the most untalented, he has quite a good brain. From a very young age, he has been taking care of Gu Xianer, and more than that, he has even been feeding her. Just by looking at him, I can tell he hasn’t been eating properly for a long time. Sometimes, I see him drinking a lot of water. It seems like he even gives Gu Xianer his own meal."

Fang Yuan's uncle says, "I am afraid if we continue this kind of behavior, Fang Yuan might refuse to acknowledge us as his parents. If Fang Yuan refuses us, that means Gu Xianer would also refuse us. Then only Fang Zheng would acknowledge us as his parents. We need to create crack between Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer's relationship in some ways."

Fang Yuan's aunt says, "How are we going to do it? That brainless pig is glued to Fang Yuan’s side, hanging on his every word like it’s a divine law!"

Fang Yuan's uncle says, "At first, I want to use Fang Zheng. But after thinking for a long time, I have found out that it has a lot of flow. But I have a proper plan. It might be harsh but it would allow us to expel him."

Fang Yuan's aunt responds with excitement, "If we can expel Fang Yuan, it would be the best. He is just a D grade trash who would become a failure in the future."

Fang Yuan's uncle says, "I am thinking about giving Fang Yuan a strong drug. One that would heighten his... sexual desires to the point where he loses all control on him. He he he. You know exactly what would happen next."

Fang Yuan's aunt responds with excitement, "This is such a good idea. How about you give me this drug and I will mix it with his meal tomorrow."

Fang Yuan's uncle responds with a calculating grin, "No, let's wait and observe him for six months. During this time, you must create a rift between Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer. After that, we will execute our plan. He he he."

At the same time, in Fang Zheng's room, Shen Cui and Fang Zheng are lying on the bed. Fang Zheng begins to focus on revising his plan, but his focus faded away as Shen Cui moves closer.

She seductively brushes against him, her touch deliberate, her intent clear. Leaning in, her breath brushes against his ear as she whispers softly, "Young Master, you have awakened extraordinary talent, just as I always believed. I know you are the most gifted. Please, allow me to serve you tonight. Let me help you reach your full potential."
Fang Zheng, unable to resist the temptation, quickly shifts his focus and gives it to his own desires.

A short while later, Fang Zheng gazes at Shen Cui, who has fallen asleep from exhaustion and ponders, "Before my death, I was old and betrayed by everyone—my wife, my children, even my own parents. In the end, I was alone. Most of the time, I found myself consuming content that no decent man should. Though my body had long failed me, my mind still burned with the desire of a young wild man. My body could no longer answer that call. I wanted to feel that manly desire at least one last time before my death, but it never came. Now, in this young body, I can finally experience what I thought I had lost forever. It's an odd sense of satisfaction that I thought I would never feel again. Now, I should focus on my future plan. At this moment, I am feeling refreshing and have a feeling that right now, I can create a perfect plan for my future. he he he."

Then Fang Zheng moves to the window, gazing out at the night sky which is full of stars with a bright moon. He stands there in silence for a moment, lost in thought, before whispering to himself in his mind, "I have decided... I will become a Venerable on the Blood Path. There are many reason behind it. Firstly, I can easily gather all the resources easily which would be necessary for my blood path cultivation. Secondly, I know the reason and method to avoid the [[Demon Judgment Board]] which detects blood path cultivator to eliminate them. Thirdly, I know the location of a lot of blood path inheritances, Gu worms. And finally, I know a lot of formulas on blood path to create new Gu worms or to update the rank of those Gu worms and the process is quite easy and fast compare to other paths."

After a brief pause, Fang Zheng continues, "To avoid detection from the Demon Judgment Board, I need pure blood. It’s difficult to acquire, but I have a plan. Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer have pure blood because they’re my siblings. Now, if either I or Fang Yuan impregnate Gu Xianer, the child born will have pure blood. If I impregnate any other women except Gu Xianer, the child will have only half pure blood. Full pure blood is ideal, but half pure blood is still acceptable."

Then Fang Zheng gives a devilish smile and ponders in his mind, "I've crafted the perfect plan to gain unlimited pure blood and half pure blood, all while taking control of the entire village. First, I’ll get closer to Gu Xianer and sow discord between her and Fang Yuan's. At the same time, I’ll form a bond with Mo Bai, the successor of the Mo Faction. Through him, I’ll gain access to his grandfather, the head of the Mo Faction, and his sister, Mo Yan. I’ll make Mo Yan fall in love with me, and through her, I’ll seize control of the Mo Faction. As for the Chi Faction, they’re already under my thumb with Chi Chen’s fabricated results. Next, I will make Yao Le, the successor of the Medicine Hall, fall for me. Through her, I will gain control over the Medicine Hall. With these three factions in my grasp, I’ll control the entire clan. Heh heh heh."

Fang Zheng's laughter echoes through the room creating an eerie environment. Then he again continues, "After six month,the merchant caravan will arrive at our village. When it does, I’ll buy a powerful drug from them and then secretly inject this drug into Fang Yuan which would amplify his sexual hunger to the point where he would lose all control on him. After losing control on himself, he’ll end up raping Gu Xianer, and as a result, she’ll become pregnant, the child born from her will be my first pure blood. Fang Yuan will be exiled for this. I’m certain he’ll take his own life, tormented by his actions, especially considering how conservative he was in his past life. But even if he doesn’t, I’ll kill him to obtain another pure blood. Heh heh heh. Afterward, I’ll get close to Gu Xianer. In the future, I’ll impregnate her repeatedly to collect an endless supply of pure blood. She is a factory for my pure blood. Ha ha ha. Half pure blood is no issue either. I can simply impregnate every girl around me. Heh heh heh."

At the same time, in Fang Yuan's room, Gu Xianer and Fang Yuan lie on the bed. Gu Xianer is saying many things. Suddenly, Gu Xianer says with trembling voice, "Brother, I will be very obedient. I will learn everything. I will learn cooking and will cook for you and will feed you. I will learn laundering and will wash all your cloth. I will learn cleaning room and will clean you room. Please, never abandon me. Promise me, you will never leave me."

Fang Yuan gives a gentle smile and responds, "I will never abandon you. I promise I will never abandon you. Have I ever lied..."

Even before Fang Yuan can complete his statement, he freezes on the spot. His gentle eyes turns into the eyes of a deep dark endless abyss without any emotion as if it is hiding a horrifying beast beneath it. Demonic Fang Yuan takes control of the body. Afterward, he releases immense killing intent towards Gu Xianer as well as grabs her neck tightly.

Everything has happened within milliseconds. Naive Fang Yuan again takes control over the body automatically. After taking control, he automatically starts crying looking at Gu Xianer who hasn't grasp the situation and are asking Fang Yuan to release her as she is feeling pain. Fang Yuan quickly releases her. 


Gu Xianer asks, "Brother, what just happened? Why did you do that? Are you... alright? You scared me."








Naive Fang Yuan can't responds as he is totally horrified. He is trembling violently and tears are pouring out like stream. Suddenly, he hugs Gu Xianer tightly as if he is seeking shelter, gathering strength, and battling the storm of fear within him. In her arms, he seeks a sanctuary, a fragile comfort that momentarily shields him from the overwhelming chaos in his mind.

Gu Xianer, caught off guard by his actions, hesitates briefly before she gently places a comforting hand on his back, her voice soft but trembling with worry. "Brother, it's okay... I am here. Don't be afraid. Please tell me what's wrong."

After sometime, Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer fall sleep in silence. Even thought their mouth can't articulate their emotion, their embrace articulate their emotion to each other in a more profound way which is not possible by mere word. 

It is first time for Fang Yuan after adolescent that he embraces Gu Xianer in this way while sleeping. Typically Fang Yuan avoids physical closeness with her, especially as she has grown older. When Gu Xianer reached adolescence, Fang Yuan Begun teaching her many life lessons; some of which would traditionally be imparted by a mother to her daughter. As he was a conservative scholar in his past life, Fang Yuan knew that words alone wouldn't leave a lasting impression. He devised a series of practical plans to educate her indirectly, implementing these lessons seamlessly into their daily lives.

For instance, when Gu Xianer first became an adolescent, Fang Yuan imposed strict rules on her interactions. He declared that she must never hug or kiss anyone, especially men, to install a sense of boundaries and caution. To reinforce this lesson, Fang Yuan prohibited her from hugging or kissing him as well. At first, Gu Xianer was deeply upset by this restriction. She had been accustomed to showing affection freely, often kissing and hugging Fang Yuan and others without hesitation. Over time, however, she accepted his rules and adjusted her behavior. Now, she rarely seeks hugs and kisses from him in normal situation and has completely stopped hugging and kissing others altogether.

Tonight is an anomaly. Fang Yuan is the one seeking comfort, breaking his usual strict discipline. Normally, after Gu Xianer entered adolescence, he avoided any physical closeness while sleeping, driven by both practicality and self-discipline. Fang Yuan understood the complexities of growing bodies and minds during adolescence and knew the risks of acting against his own principles. Maintaining a measured distance was part of his plan to teach Gu Xianer restraint and awareness.

Beyond their private interactions, Fang Yuan also takes Gu Xianer to bustling markets and other practical settings, using these experiences to teach her invaluable skills. Whether it’s negotiating prices, identifying quality goods, helping others, or observing human behavior, each outing is a carefully orchestrated lesson. These moments serve not only to prepare Gu Xianer for the realities of life but also to build her in a way that she can do everything in the future when Fang Yuan won't be on her side.

Naive Fang Yuan, with his deep understanding of life's unpredictability, incorporates even the possibility of accidents into his plans. Having been an orphan in his previous life, he knows better than most how sudden and unkind fate can be. This perspective drives him to prepare Gu Xianer for a life where she can stand strong, even in his absence.

He recognizes that mishaps and tragedies could occur at any moment, so he meticulously works to shape Gu Xianer into someone who can thrive independently. Whether it's teaching her practical skills, imparting wisdom through subtle lessons, or instilling discipline, Fang Yuan’s every action is guided by a sincere desire to protect her future. He knows that true love is not just about providing comfort and care in the present but also ensuring that the loved one can flourish even in one's absence.

This is what sets Naive Fang Yuan apart—it’s a selfless, genuine love that transcends his own fears and desires. His goal isn't to bind Gu Xianer to him or make her reliant on him; instead, it’s to equip her with the tools and resilience to face the world with confidence, no matter what happens. This love, forged in his experiences and hardships, is pure and unwavering—a love that prepares for both the best and the worst of life.
