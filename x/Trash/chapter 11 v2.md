After a few moments, Fang Zheng steps into the room, his expression painted with concern as he surveys the scene. His eyes land on Fang Yuan, who sits on the bed with tears still streaking his face, supported by Gu Xianer and Yao Le. For a moment, Fang Zheng’s expression falters—an almost imperceptible flicker of annoyance crosses his face. But it vanishes as quickly as it came, replaced with his usual warm and composed demeanor.

“Brother,” Fang Zheng says gently, stepping closer to the bed. “I heard your voice from outside. Are you alright? You’ve been through so much. I came as soon as I could.” His voice carries an air of brotherly affection, but beneath it lies his calculating thoughts.

As Fang Zheng glances at Yao Le, who is seated beside Gu Xianer, his eyes narrow ever so slightly. _So this is Yao Le, the one from the Medicine Hall? Interesting. If I can gain her trust, she’ll be the perfect key to controlling the hall. And through the Medicine Hall, I’ll have power over everyone who relies on it._

Feigning surprise, Fang Zheng directs a warm smile toward Yao Le. “You must be the kind soul I’ve heard so much about. Yao Le, isn’t it?” he says, his tone laced with subtle admiration. “Gu Xianer often mentions how much you’ve done for her and our family. I can’t thank you enough for being here during such a difficult time.”

Yao Le, caught off guard by the sudden attention, blushes faintly and fidgets with her sleeves. “I-I didn’t do much,” she stammers. “I just… wanted to help.”

Fang Zheng places a hand on his chest, his voice tinged with emotion. “No, truly. You’ve been a beacon of hope for my sister and brother. Seeing the kindness you’ve shown them fills me with gratitude. It’s rare to meet someone as selfless and caring as you.”

Yao Le glances down, her cheeks growing redder under his gaze. “I just did what anyone would do…” she murmurs, though a small, shy smile forms on her lips.

Gu Xianer, still holding Fang Yuan’s hand, looks up at Fang Zheng, her expression wary but tired from the night’s events. “Brother, you’re here too?” she asks softly, trying to mask her unease around him.

“Of course, Xianer,” Fang Zheng replies smoothly, stepping closer and crouching slightly to be at their level. “How could I not be? This is my family. Fang Yuan’s recovery means everything to me, just as it does to you.”

He shifts his gaze back to Yao Le, his expression softening even more. “I can’t imagine how hard this must have been for you, staying by their side through all this. Your strength is inspiring, Yao Le. Truly.”

Yao Le feels her heart skip a beat at his words. She looks up hesitantly, meeting his eyes, which seem filled with genuine warmth. “I… It wasn’t hard. Gu Xianer needed someone, and I was just…” she trails off, her voice faltering under his attentive gaze.

Fang Zheng’s mind works quickly, observing her reactions. _Good. She’s already responding to my words. A little more, and I’ll have her trust completely._

He places a comforting hand on her shoulder, his grip light yet reassuring. “You’re too modest. People like you are what make the world a better place. If there’s ever anything you need, please don’t hesitate to come to me. I’ll always be here to help.”

Yao Le looks up at him, her expression a mixture of flustered surprise and growing admiration. “T-thank you… that means a lot,” she says quietly.

As Fang Zheng straightens up, he glances at Gu Xianer and Fang Yuan, a faint smirk hidden behind his thoughtful expression. _One step at a time. First Yao Le, then the Medicine Hall, and eventually everything will fall into place. All I have to do is keep up this act._

For now, though, he continues to play the concerned and supportive brother, carefully weaving his words and actions to ensure his plans remain hidden.

Fang Yuan, still lying on the bed with Gu Xianer holding his hand, blinks in confusion. His brows furrow as he tries to make sense of everything. “The awakening ceremony… when is it happening?” he asks softly, his voice fragile.

Gu Xianer and Yao Le exchange nervous glances, unsure how to respond. Finally, Gu Xianer clears her throat and speaks gently, “Brother, the awakening ceremony happened many months ago… You’ve already become a Gu Master, and we’ve been at the academy for a while now.”

Fang Yuan’s eyes widen in disbelief. “What? Months? Academy? I… I don’t remember any of that.” His gaze shifts between the two girls, and his tone becomes more urgent. “What was I doing at the academy? How… how was I?”

Gu Xianer hesitates, biting her lip, but Yao Le steps in, her voice kind and soothing. “You were… trying your best, Fang Yuan. But you’ve been unconscious for some time now. A lot has happened, but it’s okay. You’re awake now, and that’s what matters.”

Fang Yuan processes her words, nodding slowly, though confusion and unease still cloud his face. He turns back to Gu Xianer. “You’re at the academy too, right? Have you been attending?”

Gu Xianer’s face falls, and she shakes her head. “No, Brother… I haven’t gone to the academy in weeks. I couldn’t leave you like this. I’ve been staying here, taking care of you.”

Hearing this, Fang Yuan feels a pang of guilt. He places his hand gently over hers. “You shouldn’t have done that, Xianer. You… you have your own life. I want you to go back to the academy. You shouldn’t fall behind because of me.”

Gu Xianer looks reluctant, but before she can respond, Yao Le chimes in, her tone bright. “That’s a great idea, Fang Yuan. Gu Xianer should go back to the academy. And you should come too!”

Fang Yuan’s brows knit together. “Me? I don’t even remember anything about the academy… What if I’m not doing well? What if—”

“Don’t worry about that,” Yao Le interrupts with a reassuring smile. “You’ll be fine. Besides, it’ll help you recover, being around people your age again. And if you’re worried, I’ll talk to my grandmother about letting me join your class. I’ll be there with you both!”

Gu Xianer looks surprised, glancing at Yao Le. “But… you’re not part of the academy…”

Yao Le grins. “True, but my grandmother has some influence with the elders. I’ll ask her to make an exception. It’ll be fun, right?”

Fang Yuan nods slowly, though his expression remains uncertain. “If you both think it’s a good idea… I’ll go. I want to know how I was doing at the academy. Maybe it’ll help me piece things together.”

Meanwhile, Fang Zheng, standing quietly nearby, hides his satisfaction behind a mask of concern. _Perfect. If Yao Le joins the academy, she’ll be even easier to manipulate. She’s already starting to trust me. With a little more effort, I’ll have her completely under my control._

He steps forward, speaking with feigned warmth. “I think it’s a great idea, Fang Yuan. Going back to the academy will help you get back to normal. And with Xianer and Yao Le by your side, you’ll be just fine.”

Fang Yuan glances at him, nodding slightly. “Alright… I’ll give it a try.”

Gu Xianer smiles softly, though her eyes still glisten with worry. “I’ll go with you, Brother. Always.”

Yao Le beams. “And I’ll talk to my grandmother right away! We’ll all be together at the academy.”

As the atmosphere lightens, Fang Zheng’s smile deepens, though his thoughts remain dark. _Everything is falling into place. Soon, Yao Le, the academy, and even Fang Yuan’s fate will be in my hands._

The next morning, Fang Yuan feels completely refreshed, as if the shadows of the past few days have lifted—at least on the surface. His movements are fluid and confident as he prepares himself for the academy. The morning light filters through the windows, and the house hums with a liveliness that has been absent for weeks.

Gu Xianer, standing by the table, watches her brother with a bright smile. She looks radiant, her spirits visibly lifted by Fang Yuan’s recovery. For the first time in weeks, she sits down to eat properly, and her joy is evident as Fang Yuan feeds her a spoonful of porridge. “Eat up, Xianer,” Fang Yuan says gently, a rare warmth in his voice. “You’ve gone without proper meals for too long.”

Gu Xianer nods enthusiastically, her cheeks flushed with happiness. “Brother, it feels like everything is back to normal. I’m so glad…” Her voice trails off, and her eyes shimmer with unshed tears, but they’re tears of relief this time.

Just as they finish their meal and begin preparing to leave for the academy, a lively voice echoes from the courtyard. “Gu Xianer! Fang Yuan! Guess what?”

They turn to see Yao Le skipping in, her energy infectious. Behind her stands an elder from the Medicine Hall, who watches with a gentle smile. Yao Le beams as she announces, “I spoke to my grandmother last night, and she agreed! I’ll be coming with you two to the academy today! It’s just for a short while, to experience academy life before I officially enroll, but I couldn’t wait to tell you!”

Gu Xianer’s eyes widen with delight. “Really? That’s amazing, Yao Le!”

Yao Le nods enthusiastically, then glances at Fang Yuan with a mischievous grin. “Now, you’ll have two people to watch over you, Fang Yuan. You’re not getting rid of us that easily!”

Fang Yuan chuckles softly, though his expression remains subdued. “It’ll be good to have you with us, Yao Le. Thank you… for everything.”

As the trio gathers their things, the house feels unusually quiet. Fang Zheng had left early in the morning, claiming he wanted to explore the area for adventure. His absence leaves an odd stillness, but neither Fang Yuan nor Gu Xianer seems to mind.

With everything set, the three of them step out of the house together. The sunlight bathes the path ahead, and the crisp morning air carries the scent of blooming flowers. Gu Xianer walks beside Fang Yuan, her hand brushing his arm occasionally, while Yao Le hums a cheerful tune, skipping slightly as they head toward the academy gates.

For the first time in a long while, there’s a sense of normalcy, of hope. Gu Xianer looks up at Fang Yuan and smiles, her excitement evident. “Brother, this is going to be a good day. I just know it.”

Yao Le nods in agreement, her laughter filling the air. “Let’s make it a great day at the academy!”

Fang Yuan glances at the two girls beside him, his heart heavy with unresolved questions and fragmented memories. Still, he nods. “Let’s go.”

And so, with the morning sun rising higher, the three of them set off toward the academy, unaware of the challenges and shadows that awaited them just beyond the horizon.

---

Two weeks pass swiftly, and the atmosphere in the academy is lively with chatter and activity. In the middle of a class, the academy elder steps forward, his voice resonating with authority as he declares, “Congratulations to Fang Yuan and Gu Xianer for successfully breaking through to the middle rank!”

The announcement is met with polite applause, though the enthusiasm in the room is mixed. Gu Xianer glances at Fang Yuan, her eyes sparkling with happiness. Fang Yuan offers her a rare, soft smile, sharing the quiet joy of their progress.

“Congratulations!” Yao Le exclaims from her seat, practically bouncing with excitement. Her bright smile is genuine, and her voice carries across the classroom. “I knew you both could do it!”

Gu Xianer grins back at her, visibly touched. “Thank you, Yao Le!”

Fang Zheng, standing nearby, also steps forward, wearing an expression of feigned sincerity. “Congratulations, both of you. Breaking through is always worth celebrating.”

But deep in his mind, his thoughts are far from kind. _"You two are celebrating breaking through to the middle rank, but you're far behind me. I've already reached the upper rank. And not just that—while you were busy lagging behind, I’ve been inheriting the Flower Wine Monk’s legacy. My strength is now at rank 1 peak stage. Ha ha ha, you’re nothing compared to me."_

Despite the elder’s congratulations, murmurs ripple through the classroom.

“What’s there to congratulate?” a boy whispers to his friends, his voice laced with disdain. “They’re late to reach the middle rank, especially Gu Xianer. She’s supposed to be a high-rank talent, but her brother has dragged her down.”

A girl chimes in, giggling mockingly, “Exactly. Fang Yuan’s clearly holding her back. She could’ve advanced long ago without him. Fang Zheng is the real prodigy here—he’s already at the upper rank!”

Another girl speaks up, her tone filled with admiration. “Fang Zheng is amazing. He’s so talented and hardworking. No wonder he’s the one everyone talks about!”

The comparisons sting, and Gu Xianer’s expression darkens. She clenches her fists, her earlier happiness replaced by a simmering fury. Yao Le, sitting beside her, also looks indignant. “That’s enough!” Yao Le snaps, her voice sharp. “You have no right to talk about them like that!”

Gu Xianer rises from her seat, glaring at the group. “You don’t know anything! My brother has worked so hard, and he’s been through so much. How dare you criticize him?!”

The murmurs stop as the girls and boys glance at each other, momentarily stunned by Gu Xianer’s outburst.

“Xianer, Yao Le,” Fang Yuan says softly, stepping between them. His voice is calm but firm. “Let it go.”

“But, brother—” Gu Xianer protests, her voice trembling with emotion.

Fang Yuan shakes his head, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder. “It doesn’t matter what they say. Words won’t change the truth.”

Yao Le frowns, clearly reluctant to back down. “But they’re being so unfair—”

“Let it go,” Fang Yuan repeats, his tone unwavering. “We don’t need to waste our energy on them.”

Though frustrated, Gu Xianer and Yao Le reluctantly step back, their expressions still tense.

From the corner of the room, Fang Zheng watches the scene unfold with an amused smirk. _"Look at you, Fang Yuan, trying to act noble. But no matter how hard you try, you’ll always be in my shadow. Let them talk—you deserve every bit of it. Soon, I’ll show everyone just how superior I am."_

As the lesson continues, the whispers die down, but the tension lingers. Fang Yuan sits quietly, his gaze distant. Though he shows no outward reaction, his heart feels heavy with the weight of the comparisons and criticisms. Yet, he hides it well, masking his thoughts behind a calm exterior.

Gu Xianer glances at her brother, worry etched across her face. She bites her lip, determined. _“I won’t let anyone talk down about brother ever again. I’ll work harder to prove them wrong.”_

Yao Le, too, casts a glance at Fang Yuan, her eyes filled with a quiet resolve. _“Fang Yuan has been through so much already. He doesn’t deserve this. I’ll stand by him, no matter what.”_

And so, while the academy elder moves on to the next topic, the undercurrents of rivalry, loyalty, and hidden schemes ripple beneath the surface, setting the stage for what’s to come.
