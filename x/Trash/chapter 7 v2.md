Seeing Fang Yuan’s reaction, Fang Zheng’s satisfaction grows as he ponders, "It is giving me very very satisfaction within me! No I want more! How about adding some more spicies. Ha ha ha." With a sly smirk, he raises his hand again, feigning indignation. “Elder,” he presses, his voice rising slightly, “what if a rank 1 Gu Master trains exceptionally hard? Could they defeat a rank 5 Gu Master? Even if my brother can’t advance his cultivation realms, surely his extraordinary strength would allow him to overcome higher-ranked opponents.”

Gu Xianer, ever eager to defend her brother, shouts enthusiastically, “Yes! Brother Fang Zheng is absolutely right! My brother will defeat not only rank 5 Gu Masters but also immortals! You’ll all see…”

Once again, Fang Yuan gently silences her, his touch firm yet tender. The room falls silent, stunned by the exchange. Fang Zheng suppresses a triumphant laugh, his thoughts swirling with glee. **_"As expected, Gu Xianer is nothing more than a naive child. My manipulation is working perfectly. This is just the first step in driving a wedge between Fang Yuan and her. Soon, she’ll irritate him with her blind faith in his abilities, and he’ll grow resentful. Eventually, he’ll start blaming her for stealing the talent that should have been his. Ha ha ha. I am making closeness with her in this way without even her knowing. Ha ha ha. You have to be very close to me as you are my unlimited source of pure blood. Everything is going according to plan. "_**

The academy elder, now both stupefied and enraged, slams his hand on the desk. "Silence, everyone!" he roars. "Let me make this crystal clear so you all grasp the harsh reality. The strength difference between each rank isn’t a mere step—it’s an exponential leap. On average, the difference between ranks is tenfold. A peak rank 2 Gu Master is ten times stronger than a peak rank 1 Gu Master. A peak rank 3 is ten times stronger than a peak rank 2, and so on. This progression continues all the way to rank 5."

He pauses, letting the weight of his words sink in. "Now, let me put this into perspective: a peak rank 5 Gu Master is ten thousand times (10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 10,000) stronger than a peak rank 1 Gu Master. As for mortals? They aren’t even ants before a peak rank 5 Gu Master, who stands at a staggering one hundred thousand times (10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 100,000) stronger than a mere mortal. Do you understand now? This is the reality of our world. Stop deluding yourselves and start accepting it!"

The elder’s words hang heavy in the air, crushing the spirits of the lower-ranked students. For Fang Yuan, it’s a devastating blow. He had once believed himself to be destined for greatness, convinced that his second chance at life would grant him unparalleled strength. Now, he feels utterly insignificant—as if comparing himself to an ant would be an insult to the insect. Tears flow freely down his cheeks, blurring his vision as he struggles to breathe. The darkness closes in around him, dragging him into an endless void of despair.

Watching Fang Yuan crumble, Fang Zheng’s satisfaction reaches new heights. **_"Manipulating Gu Xianer and the elder has paid off beautifully. Never in my life have I felt such gratification. Ha ha ha. This is only the beginning of my satisfaction. From now on, every day would be an interesting and satisfying day. Ha ha ha."_**

***"Revenge isn't about calming your anger or hatred; it's a calculated art of getting satisfaction. The more unexpected and ruthless it is, the greater the satisfaction it brings."***

Gu Xianer tries to comfort Fang Yuan but can't think of what to do, and tears start gathering in her eyes. Everyone looks discouraged and in despair. Seeing the hopeless expressions on the students' faces, the academy elder’s panic deepens. His heart races as he observes the atmosphere of despair he inadvertently created. He clenches his fists and ponders anxiously, ***"What is wrong with me today? I've always been the one to encourage even the most untalented students, to lift them up when they feel they can't go on. But now... I've crushed their spirits. I've let my frustration cloud my judgment. This isn't right—I need to fix this before it's too late."***

The academy elder, noticing the growing despair in the students' eyes, shouts with urgency, his voice trembling with both panic and determination. ***"Don't be discouraged! I haven't told you the most important truth, the factor that can change your fate!***" He takes a moment to steady himself, ensuring his words resonate with every soul in the room.

***"Heaven is not blind! If you continue to work hard without stopping, if you pour every ounce of effort and resolve into your journey, heaven will grant you the opportunities to change your fate! Remember, the more you work hard, the bigger the opportunities that will come your way!"***

The elder’s voice rings out, filled with conviction, as if trying to undo the damage he’s caused. The students look up, some with a flicker of hope, others still weighed down by doubt. Fang Yuan, however, remains silent, his tears still flowing, his mind trapped in the abyss of his despair. Gu Xianer reaches out, her small hand gripping his tightly, her own tears falling as she whispers, "Brother, don’t give up. I believe in you."

But Fang Yuan doesn’t respond. The elder’s words, though meant to inspire, feel hollow to him. The darkness within him is too deep, the weight of his failures too heavy. And yet, somewhere deep inside, a tiny spark of determination flickers—a faint reminder of the love and hope that still binds him to Gu Xianer. For her, he will keep fighting, even if the world feels like it’s crumbling around him.
