The morning sun has fully awakened, its golden rays stretching lazily across the sky, touching the world with warmth. Birds sing. The wind whispers. Peace fills the air— 

And then—

A roar. A declaration. A challenge to the cosmos itself.

“HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!”

A monstrous, earth-splitting laughter detonates through the morning calm. It’s not human. It’s not sane. It’s as if the abyss itself has learned to cackle, a sound that makes mountains tremble and rivers question their own existence. It’s the kind of laughter that makes you believe in demons—not just their existence, but their potential for extreme job promotions.

“I AM OVERFLOWING WITH POWER!” Fang Yuan bellows, his voice echoing as though the heavens themselves are taking notes for future lawsuits. “MY ADORABLE LITTLE SISTER HAS FED ME WITH HER INNOCENT LOVE, AND NOW—NOW!—I CAN FEEL IT SURGING THROUGH MY VEINS LIKE A RIVER OF PURE CHAOS! I CAN CRUSH MOUNTAINS WITH A GLANCE! CHALLENGE THE HEAVENS! REWRITE THE VERY LAWS OF EXISTENCE! DEMAND THE SUN PAY ME RENT FOR EXISTING!”

He throws his arms wide, his face a masterpiece of manic glee, eyes glowing brighter than any star in the cosmos. For a moment, he looks like he might actually ascend to godhood right then and there.

But then—suddenly—he freezes.

His body goes rigid, like someone hit pause on the universe’s remote control. His head tilts slowly, deliberately, as if gravity itself has been offended by his earlier outburst.

“…But.”

The word hangs in the air like a guillotine blade waiting to drop.

The air thickens. Silence suffocates the world. Old Man Wang stops breathing, his grip on his staff tightening until it splinters. Wang Er’s knees become a philosophical debate between standing and collapsing. Even the birds seem to collectively decide now is an excellent time to re-evaluate their life choices.

Suddenly, Fang Yuan shouts as if he is declaring his supremacy over heaven.

“WHO DARES TO FIGHT ME?! IS THERE ANYONE DARES TO FIGHT ME! WHO DARES TO TEST THE MIGHT OF THE GREAT LOVE DEMON VENERABLE, WHOSE AFFECTION IS SO BOUNDLESS, WHOSE GREATNESS SO UNFATHOMABLE, THAT THIS WORLD TREMBLES AT HIS MERCY?!”

The wind halts. The world stops breathing.

Then, like a predator selecting its prey, his eyes lock onto Gu Wang.

“Gu Wang.”

Her spine stiffens as if lightning itself has just chosen her as its favorite conductor. She glares at him, her teeth grinding together hard enough to make diamonds jealous. “What?! WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW?! ARE YOU ASKING ME TO DESCEND INTO MADNESS WITH YOU?!”

Fang Yuan’s expression shifts instantly into a mask of pure heartbreak.

His eyes narrow. His lips press into a thin line.

“Gu Wang.”

She shouts. “W-What? AGAIN?!”

Fang Yuan closes his eyes, inhaling slowly, dramatically, as if gathering the weight of the universe into his lungs.

Then—

He clutches his chest as if mortally wounded.

“You… you wound me!” His face contorts in agony, his breath hitching as though he has been pierced by an invisible blade. “Just moments ago, you pledged yourself to me as my maid! My loyal companion! My unwavering shield! And now… now you doubt me?” His voice cracks at the last word, sheer betrayal dripping from his tone. “You think I would harm you?! That I, your benevolent and loving master, would raise a hand against my most faithful servant?!”

His fingers tremble. His breath comes in gasps. His entire being radiates the aura of a man who has just been forsaken by the gods themselves.

“You… you would do this to me?” His voice wavers. “You would abandon me? Me?!”

Gu Wang stares at him, her patience crumbling like a sandcastle in a tsunami. “I AM A GIRL! I DON’T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT! HOW CAN YOU ASK ME TO BATTLE?!”

His eyes grow glossy. His breathing—ragged. He stumbles back as if the very foundations of reality have just betrayed him.

“…I trusted you.” His voice shatters. “I cherished you. I—” He sniffles. “I gave you everything. My guidance. My protection. My GREAT LOVE! I even elevated you to the sacred title of maid.”

Gu Wang’s eye twitches violently. “WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT EVEN— HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?!”

“BLASPHEMY!” Fang Yuan roars, his heartbreak flipping into fury with the speed of a lightning strike. "A MAID QUESTIONING HER MASTER?! THAT IS TREASON! HERESY! A BETRAYAL SO UNIMAGINABLE THAT THE STARS WEEP AND THE MOON CONSIDERS QUITTING ITS JOB ENTIRELY!”

Gu Wang throws up her hands, on the verge of a mental breakdown. “WHAT IN ALL THE HEAVENS ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT?!”

Fang Yuan sighs heavily, shaking his head as if he carries the burdens of an entire cosmos.

Fang Yuan suddenly gasps, as if struck by divine revelation. His entire demeanor shifts in an instant—from a battle-hungry demon to a sorrowful sage who has just uncovered the grand truth of the universe. His expression is solemn, his tone filled with deep, tragic mourning.

“No, no… I see now.” He closes his eyes, shaking his head with the weight of newfound wisdom. “You were never meant for war. You were meant to bask in my **LOVE AND GREATNESS.** How could I, a fool among fools, ask you for battle? What I should have asked for… is **your love.**”

He extends a trembling hand toward Gu Wang, eyes shimmering with what could only be described as divine affection. “Come. Come into my embrace. Let me feel the warmth of my most cherished maid.”

Silence.

Gu Wang stares at him, utterly dumbfounded. The sheer absurdity of his words sends her mind spiraling into chaos. Her lips part, then close. Her brows twitch violently. “You… WHAT?!”

Fang Yuan spreads his arms wide, his voice rising to the heavens. “Do not fear! Do not resist! Love me, Gu Wang! Love me as the heavens love the earth, as the rivers love the sea! Let my **LOVE DEMON VENERABLE AURA** embrace you!”

Gu Wang recoils so hard she nearly falls over. “WHO WANTS YOUR LOVE?! GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU FREAK!”

Fang Yuan clutches his chest, gasping as if she has stabbed him through the heart. “Agh! Such cruelty! Such cold-hearted rejection! Is this how history shall remember me? As a man whose own maid spurned his love?! _Treachery! Betrayal! Utter devastation!_”

Gu Wang's eye twitches violently. “STOP CALLING ME YOUR MAID! I’M NOT YOUR MAID! AND EVEN IF I WERE, WHAT KIND OF MASTER ASKS HIS MAID FOR LOVE?! DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?!”

Fang Yuan wobbles on his feet, as if her words have physically wounded him. He clutches at his head, staggering dramatically. “No… no, this cannot be! I am the Great Love Demon Venerable! I was born to be loved! Worshiped! Cherished! And yet, my own maid…” He falls to his knees, eyes hollow with despair. “The world… is too cruel.”

Gu Wang throws up her hands in sheer frustration. “ARE YOU SERIOUSLY HAVING AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS BECAUSE **I** WON’T LOVE YOU?!?”

Fang Yuan suddenly leaps to his feet, his sorrow vanishing in an instant. His eyes gleam with a terrifying, manic intensity. “THEN I SHALL MAKE YOU LOVE ME!”

Gu Wang takes a step back, panic flaring in her chest. “H-Hey! What do you mean by that?! Don’t say creepy things like that!”

Fang Yuan grins wildly, his expression shifting from a tragic hero to a lunatic king. “Love is war, Gu Wang. If you won’t surrender, then I shall **conquer** your heart!”

Gu Wang yells, face red with rage. “I SWEAR TO THE HEAVENS, IF YOU COME ANY CLOSER, I’LL—”

But before she can finish, Fang Yuan turns away dramatically, a heavy sigh escaping his lips. “Ah, but forcing love is not true love. No, no… I must be patient. I must let her come to me naturally. Like the moon chasing the sun. Like the wind whispering through the trees. She will realize it one day.”

Gu Wang clenches her fists so hard they crack. “REALIZE WHAT?!”

Fang Yuan turns back, flashing her a dazzling, infuriating smile.

“That she has already fallen for me.”

Gu Wang **screams.**
