Suddenly, Fang Yuan’s expression shifts. His face twists with sudden urgency, his eyes wide with fear—not for himself, but for the ones he has sworn to protect. Without hesitation, he drops to his knees, scooping Gu Xianer into his arms as if she weighs nothing. His voice erupts like thunder, sharp and commanding, cutting through the suffocating silence.

"Gu Wang! Yao Le! Follow me now! Run as fast as you can!" His words are frantic, laced with desperation. "They’re powerful Gu Masters—they’ll recover soon, and when they do, they’ll come after us! We can’t stay here!"

No one has time to process what’s happening. Confusion clouds their minds, but instinct takes over. Gu Wang and Yao Le exchange a fleeting glance, their faces pale and trembling, but Fang Yuan’s tone leaves no room for hesitation. As he sprints toward the edge of the village, clutching Gu Xianer tightly against his chest, the two girls scramble after him, their legs pumping furiously as adrenaline floods their veins.

The group bursts out of the village, leaving behind the horrors of the market. Ahead of them lies a small open field, flanked by towering rocks on one side and dense forest on the other. A mountain looms in the distance, its jagged peaks piercing the sky, while a river flows steadily on the opposite side, its waters glinting under the dim light. It’s a place both desolate and beautiful—a stark contrast to the chaos they’ve just escaped.

Reaching the field, Fang Yuan finally slows down, though his grip on Gu Xianer remains firm. He sets her down gently, his breathing ragged but controlled. Behind him, Gu Wang and Yao Le collapse to their knees, gasping for air, their chests heaving as they struggle to catch their breath. The sound of their labored breathing fills the air, mingling with the soft rustle of leaves and the distant murmur of the river.

For a moment, no one speaks. The silence is suffocating, heavy with the weight of what just transpired—a storm of violence and madness that has left the world feeling unsteady, as though reality itself might crumble under its enormity. Gu Xianer clutches at Fang Yuan’s sleeve like it’s the only thing keeping her tethered to sanity. Her tiny hands tremble violently, her knuckles white from the force of her grip. Her wide, tear-filled eyes dart around frantically, searching for answers in the chaos—but there are none. Only the grotesque remnants of carnage behind them, a grim reminder of the monster standing before her.

Gu Wang stares blankly at the ground, her mind racing so fast it feels like it’s about to shatter. She tries desperately to piece together some semblance of logic, some way to make sense of the nightmare they’ve just endured—but nothing fits. It’s all wrong. Too much blood. Too much brutality. And yet… Fang Yuan stands tall amidst it all, his chest heaving, his lips curled into an unsettling grin, as if this were all part of some grand performance meant solely for his amusement.

Yao Le sits hunched over, her delicate frame quivering like a leaf caught in a gale. Silent tears stream down her cheeks, carving paths through the dust and grime on her face. Her breath comes in shallow gasps, each inhale sharp and ragged, as though even the act of breathing requires more strength than she possesses. Her hands clutch at her knees, nails digging into the fabric of her dress, leaving crescent-shaped marks where fear has taken hold.

And then—

A sound cuts through the oppressive stillness. Footsteps. Slow, uneven, dragging against the earth. Someone is coming from the forest.

Gu Wang freezes, her body locking up as primal fear floods her veins. Yao Le whimpers softly, her trembling intensifying as her gaze darts toward the trees. Even Gu Xianer stiffens, her small frame pressed closer to Fang Yuan instinctively, seeking shelter in the shadow of the very man who moments ago unleashed such unholy fury.

But Fang Yuan—Fang Yuan doesn’t flinch. Instead, he throws his head back and laughs, a wild, unhinged cackle that echoes through the clearing like the howl of a beast. His eyes gleam with manic delight, his grin stretching impossibly wide as he turns to the girls, his voice dripping with mockery and affection all at once.

“Don’t be afraid!” he declares, waving a hand dismissively. “You two are my maids now! Nothing will happen to you while I’m here! HA HA HA!”

Gu Wang blinks, her jaw slackening as confusion battles with terror. She looks at Fang Yuan, then shifts her gaze to Yao Le, her voice barely above a whisper. “Are… are you also his maid?”

Yao Le’s head snaps up, her already pale face turning ghostly white. She stares at Gu Wang, bewildered, before turning her wide, frightened eyes to Fang Yuan. Her lips part, but no words come out—only a silent question, a plea for clarity in the midst of insanity.

Fang Yuan notices her confusion and lets out another booming laugh, throwing his arms wide in theatrical exuberance. “HA HA HA! Oh, sweet little Yao Le! Did I forget to tell you? Yesterday, during our little adventure, I decided—you shall be my maid too! Yes, yes! My cute, angelic maid! HA HA HA! You should feel honored! Truly, deeply honored!”

He strikes a grand pose, tilting his head back dramatically as sunlight filters through the trees, casting a golden halo around him. For a fleeting moment, he looks almost divine—a figure of awe-inspiring power and majesty. But the illusion is shattered by the madness in his eyes, the cruel twist of his grin.

“I am the Great Love Demon Venerable!” he announces, his voice thunderous, reverberating through the air like a proclamation from the heavens themselves. “And you have been chosen by me—as my maid! HA HA HA!”

His declaration hangs in the air, absurd and terrifying in equal measure. It’s loud enough to carry across the clearing—and it reaches the ears of the man stumbling out of the forest.

The newcomer freezes mid-step, his blood-soaked form swaying unsteadily. His clothes are torn, his skin pale and clammy, streaks of crimson staining every inch of visible flesh. He looks like death incarnate, yet his expression shifts instantly upon hearing Fang Yuan’s words. Fear overtakes him, raw and primal, as his gaze locks onto Fang Yuan. His entire body begins to shake uncontrollably, as though the mere sight of the self-proclaimed “Great Love Demon Venerable” has sapped the last remnants of his strength.

Yao Le recognizes him immediately and cries out, her voice cracking with desperation. “Clan Leader! What happened to you?!”

The man cannot respond. His mouth opens and closes soundlessly, his eyes locked onto Fang Yuan with sheer, unadulterated terror. Every fiber of his being screams that a single misstep—a single wrong word—could mean his end. He stands frozen, trapped between the horrors he has already faced and the looming specter of the madman before him.

Fang Yuan tilts his head slightly, his lips curling into a gentle, almost kind smile. "I think you're quite late," he says softly, his voice carrying an eerie calmness that sends shivers down the man's spine.

The words hit like a thunderclap. The clan leader’s mind is yanked back to the nightmare—the suffocating abyss where Fang Yuan had commanded him to come quickly, not to be late. His breath hitches, vision blurring as panic threatens to overwhelm him. But before he can fully succumb to the paralyzing fear, Fang Yuan speaks again, his tone light yet laced with menace.

"I will visit you tonight."

The leader’s blood runs cold. His knees nearly buckle under the weight of those simple words. Memories of the dream flood back—the flickering torchlight, the endless suffering, the rocks piercing flesh, and Fang Yuan’s indifferent gaze watching it all unfold. It was supposed to be just a dream, wasn’t it? Yet here he stands, face-to-face with the very figure who haunted his subconscious.

Flesh-and-blood reality collides with the surreal horror of his memories.

"But for now," Fang Yuan continues, his voice deceptively soft, "there's a mess in the market. Go and fix it. Those filthy men dared to extend their hands toward _my_ girls."

The leader nods frantically, trembling so violently that his teeth chatter. "Y-Yes! Of course!" he stammers, desperate to escape the oppressive aura surrounding Fang Yuan. "I’ll punish them immediately!"

Fang Yuan’s smile grows warmer, almost polite, as though they are discussing nothing more consequential than the weather. "Please, Clan Leader, go and deal with those who dare touch what belongs to me."

Despite the gentleness of Fang Yorkers tone, something about his expression—the faint glimmer of amusement in his eyes, the unnerving stillness of his posture—makes the leader’s stomach churn. He wants to move, to flee, but his body refuses to obey. Fear roots him to the spot, rendering him incapable of action.

Suddenly, Fang Yuan’s demeanor shifts. The warmth vanishes, replaced by an emotionless void. His eyes harden into twin abysses, devoid of mercy or humanity. When he speaks next, his voice is low, commanding, and utterly devoid of warmth.

"Are you leaving," he asks, each word dripping with quiet menace, "or do I need to remind you of what you experienced in your dream? And what you saw in the forest?"

The effect is instantaneous. The clan leader’s mind goes blank, consumed by primal terror. His legs tremble uncontrollably, and sweat pours down his face. Without conscious thought, his instincts take over, forcing him to turn and run as fast as his shaking limbs will allow.

He doesn’t look back. He can’t. Because deep down, he knows: if he does, he might see Fang Yuan standing there, watching him with that same chilling smile—and this time, there would be no reprieve.
