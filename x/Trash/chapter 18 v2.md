Gu Xianer’s breath catches in her throat as she pulls Fang Yuan’s frail body closer to hers. Her hands tremble violently, a cocktail of fear, love, and desperation swirling within her. **I can save him. I can heal him.** But doubt claws at her heart, dragging her down into the depths of uncertainty. **What if I cause more damage? What if I shatter his bones, or make things worse?**

Her hands hover above him, trembling, as her fingertips brush his skin. She can feel his cold, broken body beneath her. His blood-soaked skin, the mangled limbs, the jagged shards of his skull—all of it weighs on her chest like a crushing stone.

For a long moment, she is paralyzed by her fear. But then, a spark of resolve ignites in her chest. **No, I won’t let him die. Not like this. Not while I still have a chance.**

With a ragged breath, she remembers the lesson Fang Yuan gave her in the dream. She knows how to do this. She must channel her primeval essence into him. Every drop will carry her will, her emotions—the very essence of herself.

She embraces him with trembling arms, her hands shaking as she begins to channel the raw energy. The primeval essence pours from her like a flood, surging through her veins and into his broken body. Her emotions flood the energy—her fear, her desperation, her unrelenting love. The power is untamed, coursing through her and into him.

For a moment, nothing happens. The stillness is suffocating. Gu Xianer’s heart drops. She tries again, pouring more of herself into him, each drop of energy stronger than the last. She feels it. The energy swirling, mingling with her will, with the fire of her determination to save him.

Then, the faintest crackling sound breaks the silence.

Her heart skips a beat. **It’s working. It’s really working.**

She feels the bones in his legs, once shattered beyond recognition, slowly realigning. The joints snap back into place, one by one, with a subtle, almost miraculous movement. The skin, once pale and bruised, begins to flush with life. Her breath catches as his chest rises and falls, steady and deep, his ribcage knitting together, the broken pieces mending.

The miracle unfolds before her eyes—his arms, twisted and stiff, begin to shift under her touch, growing stronger. His legs firm beneath her fingers. Every part of his body she touches is healing, mending as though it’s the most natural thing in the world.

But then, her gaze lands on his skull. Her heart sinks.

The injury is too severe. The crack in his skull is jagged and raw, the bone exposed to the air. No matter how much energy she pours into him, it refuses to heal. The broken skull resists. She can feel the healing power unable to reach that part of him.

**Why won’t it heal? Why can’t I fix it?**

Despair wells up in her chest like a tidal wave. The tears, once threatening to fall, now spill over. Her body is drained, numb from the effort. Her hands grow colder with each passing second. But she won’t stop. She can’t stop.

She presses her forehead against his, her voice a hoarse whisper. “Please… don’t leave me. Please… let me heal you…”

But no matter how much she pours into him, the skull remains broken. She has used every ounce of her energy, but it’s not enough. She can feel herself slipping—her body nearly as broken as his had been.

Suddenly, a soft voice breaks through the storm in her mind.

"Sister, you have done a miracle."

Gu Xianer doesn’t react at first. She’s too focused on her efforts, her hands still trembling on Fang Yuan’s body, unwilling to let go. The voice continues, gentle but insistent. “You’ve already worked a miracle. His body is healed. He is alive. Don’t you see?”

Her hands linger, but the truth begins to seep into her heart. She looks at Fang Yuan—the signs are undeniable. His body, once shattered and broken, now looks whole. He’s breathing, his skin flushed with life. She has done this. She’s saved him.

But still, the fractured skull weighs heavy on her heart.

Gu Wang’s voice is soft, but filled with a warmth that pierces through her exhaustion. “His body is healed. His bones are whole. He’s breathing. He just needs rest. He will wake up.”

Gu Wang gently embraces Gu Xianer from behind, her voice a comforting murmur. “You need to rest too, Xianer. You’ve given him everything. He’s fine now. His body is healed, but you’re exhausted. You’ve done enough.”

Gu Xianer’s voice is barely a whisper, a thread of fear still clinging to her words. “But what if he doesn’t? What if he’s still slipping away?”

Gu Wang shakes her head gently, her voice firm but soothing. “He’s fine now. His body is healed, Xianer. You’ve done more than anyone could have. You’ve given him the strength to fight.”

She pulls back slightly to look into Gu Xianer’s tear-streaked face, offering her a soft, reassuring smile. “But you need to rest too, Xianer. You’ve been through so much. You’ve been fighting for him—fighting for both of you—and now you need to take care of yourself too.”

Gu Xianer looks up at her, uncertainty clouding her eyes. But Gu Wang, ever the light in the darkness, continues with a playful note in her voice, “Do you want him to wake up and see you like this? Covered in blood, barely clothed, exhausted, and broken?”

Gu Xianer blinks, caught off guard by the question, a slight flush rising in her cheeks.

“Or…” Gu Wang leans in, her smile growing wider. “Do you want to surprise him? Make him smile when he wakes up. Be strong for him, Xianer. Don’t let him see you in this state.”

Gu Xianer wipes her eyes, sniffling, but a glimmer of hope begins to spark in her gaze. The weight of her fear begins to lift, replaced by something lighter, something warmer.

Gu Wang continues, her tone lighthearted yet full of care. “Look at yourself—look at him. He’s almost healed now. He’s fine. But the skull... and the bed…” She gestures at the messy sheets around them. “It’s a mess. We need to clean up before he wakes up. And you…” She takes Gu Xianer’s hands in hers, squeezing them gently. “You need to take a bath. Change into something nice. You’re beautiful, Xianer, but you need to feel like yourself again. Let me help you.”

Gu Xianer looks at her, and a flicker of determination rises within her, something new breaking through the exhaustion. “And then… we make him breakfast,” she murmurs.

Gu Wang beams, her energy infectious. “Exactly! You and I are the same height, right?” She teases with a wink. “You can wear my clothes while I help you take a proper bath, and then we’ll make him the best breakfast. A surprise for when he wakes up.”

Gu Xianer’s lips tremble into a faint smile, and for the first time in what feels like forever, something light shines in her eyes.

“I’ll do it,” she whispers, her voice steady. “I’ll make him smile. I’ll do it for him.”

Gu Wang hugs her tightly, her smile broadening. “That’s my strong sister.”

Gu Wang, ever the bright presence, helps her sit up with gentle hands, guiding her to the small wooden tub she had prepared earlier. The water inside is warm, steam rising in soft curls, a stark contrast to the cold exhaustion that lingers around Gu Xianer. She’s too drained to resist, her body moving sluggishly as she follows Gu Wang’s instructions.

The warmth of the water seems to revive Gu Xianer’s exhausted body, the heat soaking into her muscles, helping to ease the tension and pain. As she sinks into the tub, her eyes close, and for a moment, she allows herself to relax, knowing that she is in safe hands. The blood that had clung to her body like a second skin is now slowly being washed away by Gu Wang’s careful touch.

Gu Wang’s hands are gentle but firm, moving across Gu Xianer’s body with tender reverence as she scrubs away the dried blood and grime that has caked onto her skin. She’s careful not to be too rough, mindful of the exhaustion in Xianer’s body, but at the same time, there's a quiet urgency in her movements. She wants to help Xianer, to restore her, as much as she can.

“Let’s get you cleaned up, sister,” Gu Wang says with a teasing smile, but her eyes are full of concern as she surveys Gu Xianer’s state. Her hands are tender as she undoes Gu Xianer’s clothes, carefully peeling the blood-soaked fabric from her body. As she does so, she gently wipes away the blood, her fingertips brushing against Gu Xianer’s skin with the utmost care. The younger girl barely reacts, the weight of the moment too heavy on her to feel the discomfort.

“Thank you,” Gu Xianer whispers, her voice hoarse, though she’s not sure exactly what she’s thanking Gu Wang for. Perhaps for being the person who stayed beside her when everything seemed impossible. Perhaps for simply being there.

Gu Wang smiles softly, not responding with words but with a reassuring squeeze of Xianer's hand. She runs a warm washcloth over Xianer’s face, gently cleaning away the blood that had clung to her cheeks and neck, all while keeping a steady rhythm, as if the action itself would ease the other girl’s burdens.

After a while, when Xianer is clean, Gu Wang pauses, noticing the small trembling that persists in her frame, even after the bath. She places a gentle hand on her shoulder, looking her in the eye. “You’re not alone anymore, You have me now. We’ll take care of each other. By the way, I realized something. We’ve been through so much, and I haven’t even asked your name.” She chuckles lightly, trying to break the tension in the air. “Silly me. My name is Gu Wang,” she says, offering a small but warm smile. “What should I call you?”

Gu Xianer blinks, still feeling a little disoriented from everything that happened. But something in her stirs—a warmth, a connection. She smiles faintly and responds, "My name is Gu Xianer."

Gu Wang beams, the playful glint never leaving her eyes. “Well, you can always call me Sister Wang,” she says, her voice full of affection. “And I’ll call you sister Xianer. and how about you let me become you big sister so that I can take care of you. How’s that?”

For the first time, a real smile spreads across Gu Xianer’s face. The idea of having a big sister, someone to rely on, feels almost foreign to her. But it’s a comforting thought. She nods, her heart swelling with an unfamiliar sense of security.

“Now, let’s get you dressed up. You’re going to look absolutely beautiful,” Gu Wang says as she rummages through her things, pulling out a dress that she knows will make Gu Xianer look like a true lady. “This one. It’s perfect for you.”

Gu Wang helps her into a soft, flowing gown, its color a pale lavender that complements Gu Xianer’s delicate features. She adjusts it carefully, smoothing it down her back and adjusting the laces. “Perfect,” Gu Wang murmurs as she takes out a beautiful hairpin and a delicate clip.

She gathers Gu Xianer’s long hair and begins to work, carefully weaving it into a simple but elegant style. The hairpin goes in with a flourish, and the clip at the side makes it look even more refined. Gu Xianer watches in the mirror, awestruck by how different she looks, how she feels now, clean and fresh and somehow stronger.

Gu Wang steps back, giving her a look of approval. “You look stunning, Sister Xianer,” she says, her voice soft with admiration. “You deserve to feel beautiful.”

Gu Xianer’s face flushes with a warmth she hasn’t felt in a long time. “Thank you,” she says, her voice barely above a whisper.

Gu Wang smiles, turning toward a small tray with food she had prepared earlier. She moves with grace, as though it’s second nature to her, and begins feeding Gu Xianer in small, gentle bites. There’s a tenderness to her movements, like she’s caring for her own sister, a bond that has formed in the midst of everything.

As Gu Xianer eats, her eyes start to glisten again, her heart full of emotions she hasn’t let herself feel. The warmth of the food, the kindness in Gu Wang’s eyes—it’s almost too much to bear. Tears fill her eyes, spilling down her cheeks once more. It’s not sadness this time, but an overwhelming sense of love and warmth—something she thought she had lost forever.

“Don’t cry, Sister Xianer,” Gu Wang says softly, brushing a tear from her cheek. “You’ve done so much for him. Now let me take care of you, just for a little while.”

Gu Xianer nods, unable to speak, overwhelmed by the warmth that seems to seep into her very soul. It’s the same feeling she gets when Fang Yuan feeds her, that gentleness and care that makes her feel safe, like nothing could ever hurt her again. She feels as if she’s finally found a place where she belongs.

Once Gu Xianer has regained some strength, she stands, her newfound energy giving her a sense of purpose. With steady hands, she approaches Fang Yuan again, the emotional weight lighter than before.

She places her hand gently on his cheek, her fingers trembling slightly as she leans forward, her forehead touching his. The contact sends a jolt through her. She pours her primeval essence into him once more, this time through their foreheads, connecting their souls, her heart beating in time with his as the energy flows.

For a long moment, nothing seems to change, but then, there’s a shift. Gu Xianer feels the final pieces of Fang Yuan’s body knitting together, the damage mending, the bones fully healing. The pulse of life is unmistakable. When she pulls back, she sees him—truly healed—his features strong, his once-fractured body now firm and robust.

She smiles softly, the last of her doubts slipping away as she stands back, her heart swelling with joy. He’s healed. He’s back. And now, she can truly move forward.

Gu Wang joins her, the two of them carefully cleaning Fang Yuan’s body, making sure he’s comfortable. Together, they lift him gently, transporting him to a cleaner room. They arrange him with the same care they had shown for each other.

Old man wang and Wang Er also help them where it is needed. But they can't help properly because of fear. Even while taking breath, they consider as if it doesn't create any sound. They are too frightened.

***"A first impression is like a deep mark on a stone—it is hard to remove once it is carved. If you make others feel fear at first, no matter how much you smile later, they will still feel that fear. Even if you show your true self, they will see it as a disguise of yours."***

Once that task is done, they head to the kitchen to prepare breakfast, the air lighter now, filled with the sound of laughter and the quiet hum of two girls who’ve just formed an unbreakable bond. They make plans for the future, small conversations about what they’ll do when Fang Yuan wakes up, and how they can show him that they’re strong, not just for him, but for each other.

As they prepare, Gu Xianer looks over at Gu Wang, her face soft with affection. “Thank you, Sister Wang,” she whispers.

Gu Wang’s smile is radiant. “You don’t need to thank me, Sister Xianer. I’ll always be here for you.”
