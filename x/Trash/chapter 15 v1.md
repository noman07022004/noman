In a quiet room,

Yao Le buried her face in the pillow, her cheeks burning with the thoughts racing through her mind. “Why am I like this? He’s just… so kind, so handsome. The way he smiles, the way he takes care of Gu Xianer—it’s all so perfect. What if he treats his wife with the same tenderness? No, no! Stop it, Yao Le!” she scolded herself, her voice muffled. 

She rolled onto her side, holding the jade fox figurine he had given her earlier. “Does he even like me? What should I do to become someone worthy of him?” Her blush deepened, and she groaned into the pillow. “I must have gone mad. It’s just admiration, nothing else! But… if he were the surprise grandmother mentioned…”

As she rolled once more, giggling nervously at her own foolishness, a shadow loomed over her. It wasn’t until she flipped onto her back that she froze, her heart lurching violently. Standing at the foot of her bed was Fang Yuan, his calm yet knowing smile radiating a charm that made her cheeks burn brighter.

Behind him stood her grandmother, her expression a mix of pride and mischief.

Yao Le bolted upright, clutching the pillow to her chest as though it were a shield. “W-what are you doing here?!” she stammered, her voice high-pitched with embarrassment. Her wide eyes darted between the two of them. “Grandmother! Why is Fang Yuan here with you?”

Her grandmother stepped forward, her eyes twinkling with excitement and a hit of happiness. “Calm down, child. I brought young master Fang Yuan here because he wants to give you a gift. Ok I am leaving. Cooperate with Young Master Fang Yuan.”

Yao Le’s mind races. “Fang Yuan wants to give me a gift?! I am alone and it is at night. My grandmother is leaving while telling me to cooperate with Young Master Fang Yuan. My grandmother always tells me that she will take good care of my child. Does that mean… No no.” She feels like her entire world is spinning out of control. She glances at Fang Yuan, whose composed expression only made her heart race faster. “I-I didn’t mean anything! I wasn’t thinking anything strange, I promise! It is too early. We should get married first.” Seeing her grandmother leaving, she shouts, “Grandmother, wait. Don’t leave me alone. Give me sometime.” Suddenly, Fang Yuan asks, “Let's talk for a minute. Please calm down.”

Her cheeks feel like they’re on fire, and she instinctively pulls the pillow higher, shielding half of her face. “I-I’m calm!” she blurts, her voice an octave too high. “Why wouldn’t I be calm? You’re just here… in my room… at night… and my grandmother just… left us…” Her words dissolve into incoherent mumbling as she ducks her head, refusing to meet his gaze.

Fang Yuan steps closer, his movements deliberate but unthreatening. He kneels by the bed, lowering himself to her eye level. “Yao Le, you’re overthinking this.” His tone is warm, and the faint smile on his lips makes her stomach do flips. “I am leaving this village tomorrow. So, I have come here to give you a gift and hope you will continue helping my sister.”

Yao Le’s heart sinks at Fang Yuan’s words, her grip on the pillow tightening as if it could steady the sudden storm inside her. “Leaving?” she whispers, her voice barely audible. Her gaze flights to his face, searching for some hint that he might be joking, but his calm expression tells her otherwise.

“Yes,” Fang Yuan confirms gently. “I want to wander around the world for some personal reason. But before I leave, I want to thank you properly.”

Yao Le’s chest tightens, a mixture of disappointment and confusion swirling within her. She lowers the pillow slightly, her voice shaky. “Thank me? But… I didn’t do anything special. Gu Xianer is like a sister to me. I was just doing what any friend would.”

Fang Yuan chuckles softly, the sound as soothing as a summer breeze. “You underestimate yourself, Yao Le. Xianer has been through a lot, and having someone as kind and lively as you by her side means more to her—and to me—than you realize.”

Her cheeks burn even hotter at his words, and she averts her eyes, clutching the pillow to her chest. “I-I just… I don’t know what to say…”

Fang Yuan says, “Prepare yourself, because I am going to give you an immortal inheritance.” She becomes shocked and asks many questions. Fang Yuan responds, “I don’t have much time. You will understand everything when you receive it.”

After that Fang Yuan uses hope gu to awaken her aperture and then uses many gu worms and primeval stones to increase her rank while maintaining as low damage as possible. And then seal off her cultivation realms and then also gives her inheritance. 

After 5 hours, Yao Le looks extremely tired. She faints on the spot. Fang Yuan takes her in his lap and puts her on the bed. Afterward, he leaves the house without saying anything to anyone.

  

At Gu Xianer’s room, the air is filled with the faint glow of the lanterns and the warmth of sibling chatter.

“Why is my brother so late? It’s already 10,” Gu Xianer grumbles, rolling on her bed with an exaggerated pout.

Gu Wang, standing nearby with a soft smile, reassures her. “Don’t worry, the young master will be here soon.”

Gu Xianer huffs. “I’m feeling hungry as well as sleepy. If he doesn’t come soon, I might faint!”

Just then, the door creaks open, and Fang Yuan steps in, carrying a basket laden with food.

“Brother!” Gu Xianer shouts with excitement, leaping off the bed. “What did you bring for our night dinner?”

Fang Yuan places the basket on the table and smiles gently. “Look, Xianer, I brought your favorite from when we were children. And this—” he lifts a small wrapped package, “something you’ve never tried before.”

The trio sits together, the room filled with the comforting aroma of freshly prepared food. They laugh and share stories as they eat, the bond between them palpable in every glance and word.

After finishing, Gu Xianer suddenly furrows her brows and slams her chopsticks on the table. “Brother! I told you I’d feed you tonight, but you went ahead and did everything. Why do I always keep forgetting things? Is there something wrong with me?”

Fang Yuan chuckles softly, reaching out to pat her head. “There’s nothing wrong with you, my adorable little sister. It’s normal to forget small things sometimes. Do you know what it means?”

Gu Xianer, still pouting, turns to him with suspicion. “What?”

“It means that those who forget normal things when they’re young often become great memorizers when they grow up,” he says with a playful grin. “So, don’t worry. You’re destined for greatness. Just don’t forget your brother then, alright?”

Gu Xianer’s cheeks puff in mock anger, and she looks away, trying to hide a smile. “What are you talking about? Are you mad?”

Fang Yuan turns to Gu Wang, who’s been quietly observing the scene, her lips curled into a hidden smile. “Gu Wang, you’re smiling too much for someone who’s trying to stay quiet,” he teases, making Gu Wang blush and quickly look away.

Then Fang Yuan shifts the conversation, his tone turning a bit wistful. “My little sister, have you ever thought about a life beyond this village? Imagine your brother going out into the vast world, adventuring and bringing back treasures you’ve never seen before.”

Gu Xianer’s eyes sparkle with curiosity. “That does sound interesting. But if you’re going out, I want to come with you! We could see new places together, learn new things, and eat all kinds of delicious food!”

Fang Yuan chuckles, though his gaze softens with a hint of sadness. “What if I leave tomorrow, Xianer? To explore the world, to bring back wonders you can’t even imagine? Wouldn’t that be exciting?”

Gu Xianer’s playful demeanor shifts as she grips his sleeve tightly. “No. If you’re leaving tomorrow, then I’m coming too. I won’t let you leave me behind.”

Fang Yuan gently places his hand over hers. “Xianer, it’s not about leaving you behind. It’s about bringing something back for you, for everyone. Imagine me coming home with new stories, new treasures, and foods you’ve never tasted. Wouldn’t that be something to look forward to?”

Gu Xianer stares at him, her lips trembling slightly. “But what if something happens to you? What if you don’t come back?”

Fang Yuan smiles, a glimmer of warmth and reassurance in his eyes. “I’ll always come back. To you, to this family. You’re my little sister, Xianer. Nothing will keep me away for long.”

Turning to Gu Wang, he adds, “Don’t you think it’ll be exciting, Gu Wang? New things for everyone, new adventures to share when I return?”

Gu Wang nods, though her voice is quiet. “It would be interesting… but it’ll be lonely without you, young master.”

Fang Yuan smiles at her sincerity. “I trust you to take care of Xianer while I’m gone. She’s in good hands, isn’t she?”

Gu Xianer, her eyes glistening with unshed tears, nods. “Gu Wang’s a good girl. But… I still don’t want you to leave.”

Fang Yuan kneels before her, holding both her hands. “Then let’s make a deal. While I’m gone, you’ll live here with Gu Wang, and both of you will wait for me. When I come back, I’ll bring so many things you won’t even know where to start!”

Gu Xianer hesitates, her heart torn between the thought of letting him go and the promise of his return. Finally, she nods, though her voice is barely a whisper. “Promise me you’ll come back soon, brother.”

Fang Yuan smiles, pulling her into a warm embrace. “I promise, Xianer. Always.”

As the night deepens, their bond feels stronger than ever, even as the horizon of their shared world begins to expand.
