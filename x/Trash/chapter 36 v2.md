Fang Yuan smirks, his gaze flickering briefly toward Gu Wang before settling back on his sister. “It’s a story about a good brother and sister who were tricked by a witch…” His voice carries an edge of mischief as he adds, “…a witch who wore the mask of a pure, gentle girl.” The mockery in his tone is unmistakable, and his lingering glance at Gu Wang only deepens her unease.

Gu Wang shifts uncomfortably, her instincts screaming that something isn’t right. _Why does he keep looking at me like that? And that wicked smile… What is he planning?_ she wonders silently, a faint echo of alarm resonating in her mind.

Gu Xianer, oblivious to the tension, claps her hands together with excitement. “Oh! This sounds thrilling! Tell me more!”

Fang Yuan nods solemnly, though the corner of his lips twitches with barely concealed amusement. “Once upon a time, in a beautiful village nestled between lush mountains, there lived a loving brother and sister. They cared for each other deeply, sharing every joy and sorrow. One day, during an adventure outside their village, they became lost and took shelter in a mysterious house.”

He pauses, letting the suspense build, his voice softening into a hypnotic cadence. “In that house, they met a seemingly kind-hearted girl—a girl so gentle, so pure, that she seemed too good to be true. She took excellent care of them, feeding them, tending to their needs, and even offering to teach the little sister many wonderful things. The brother was overjoyed, believing his sister had found a true friend, someone who would guide her toward goodness.”

His expression darkens subtly, his playful grin returning as he turns his full attention to Gu Wang. “But alas…” he drawls, his voice dripping with mock sorrow, “…this ‘pure’ girl was no saint. Beneath her innocent facade lay a mind filled with wicked thoughts—thoughts so dirty, so vile, that one could hardly believe such corruption existed.”

Gu Wang stiffens, her cheeks flushing red as realization dawns. Her fists clench tightly at her sides, but she forces herself to remain silent, glaring daggers at Fang Yuan. She tries to focus on her meal, but the bite in her mouth feels stuck in her throat as she anticipates where this twisted tale is heading. With great effort, she swallows it down, trying to steady her breathing.

Ignoring her reaction entirely, Fang Yuan continues, his tone shifting to one of exaggerated pity. “This witch followed the brother and sister home, worming her way into their lives. Both the brother and sister grew fond of her, unaware of her true nature. Oh, how tragic!” He sighs theatrically, shaking his head. “For while the brother believed she was teaching his precious sister noble virtues, she was instead planting seeds of impurity in her young mind.”

Gu Xianer tilts her head, confusion clouding her innocent eyes. “What do you mean, Brother? What kind of impurity?”

Gu Wang freezes, the bite in her mouth suddenly impossible to chew.

Fang Yuan chuckles softly, leaning closer to Gu Wang with a teasing smirk. “Why, the kind of thoughts only a _bad girl_ would entertain,” he says, emphasizing the words with a sly glance at Gu Wang. “Very bad and wicked witches can only think such things. What do you say, Gu Wang?”

Her face erupts in a fiery blush, indignation boiling over. She quickly swallows the food in her mouth and snaps, “WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! HOW DARE YOU SAY SUCH THINGS!”

Gu Xianer looks between them curiously. “What kind of bad things, Brother? Can you clarify?”

Before Fang Yuan can respond, Gu Wang shouts in panic, “It’s nothing!”

Suddenly, Fang Yuan places another bite of rice into Gu Xianer’s mouth and asks gently, “Do you really want to know?”

While chewing, Gu Xianer nods affirmatively.

Gu Wang panics, shouting, “What the hell are you saying?! Stop right there!”

Fang Yuan teases her further, his voice dripping with amusement. “Why are you preventing me? Can you tell me how you know all those bad things? How exactly do you know about them?”

Gu Wang grits her teeth, unable to respond. “You…!”

Fang Yuan laughs, clearly enjoying himself. “Eat your meal; don’t get angry. It makes me so satisfied to see you frustrated. Every shout, every curse—it’s like the melody of an angel fallen into the hands of a demon. But the angel doesn’t realize that the demon has lived in hell, and even her anger sounds like music to him. Ha ha ha!”

Gu Wang forces herself to calm down, focusing on her meal. _That’s right,_ she thinks, taking slow, deliberate bites. _The angrier I become, the more he enjoys it. I won’t react to his provocations anymore. Calm down. Calm down._

As she chews, Fang Yuan turns to Gu Xianer, feeding her another bite. Then, in a chilling voice that shakes with feigned fear, he says, “Think about it, my Xianer. You love me very much, and you also love Gu Wang, right?”

Gu Xianer nods enthusiastically while still chewing.

Fang Yuan continues, his voice trembling as if he’s facing imminent doom. “Xianer, how would you feel if Gu Wang secretly planned to take your brother away? Not only that, what if she used her witch powers to suck out your brother’s life force to create a new life within herself? And then, what if she used your brother to do terrible things—a fate unfit for a good, virtuous, pure, noble girl…”

Before he can finish, Gu Wang explodes, “You! What are you talking about?! I’ve never—!”

Fang Yuan ignores her completely, turning to Gu Xianer with wide, fearful eyes. “Xianer, will you protect me if the time comes when Gu Wang or anyone else tries to harm me?”

Gu Wang shouts furiously, “Stop! Right there! If you say one more word, I’m leaving immediately!”

Gu Xianer blinks, confused, then responds earnestly, “Brother, don’t be sad. Gu Wang is a good girl. If anything like this happens, I’ll protect you.”

Gu Wang gives Gu Xianer a gentle glance, her voice soft but firm. “Don’t pay attention to your brother’s nonsense.”

Gu Xianer tilts her head, still processing everything. “Okay. Please complete the story. The meal is almost finished, but you haven’t finished the story yet, Brother.”

Gu Wang remains silent, her frustration mounting. She stares at her food angrily, squeezing the rice in her hand with all her might before shoving it into her mouth and chewing fiercely.

Fang Yuan chuckles, ruffling Gu Xianer’s hair affectionately. “Of course, my sweet sister. Where were we? Ah yes—the witch tries to do bad things to the brother, but the sister, being very intelligent, catches the witch and prevents her from harming her brother. Do you like the story?”

Hearing this, Gu Wang angrily takes another bite, chewing it with barely contained rage.

Gu Xianer beams with excitement. “Yes, Brother! It was a really good story. I liked it! I’ll protect you from any harm.”

Fang Yuan pretends to tear up, his voice quivering as he asks Gu Xianer, “My Xianer, I know you liked my story. Can you please ask Gu Wang if she enjoyed it too?”

At this, Gu Wang’s eyes widen in disbelief. She stares at Fang Yuan, unsure of what to do as her brain momentarily shuts down under the weight of his relentless teasing.

---
Gu Wang’s mind erupts into chaos, her thoughts crashing against each other like a violent storm unleashed. Her fists are clenched so tightly that her knuckles turn white, the blood seemingly frozen in her veins. Yet, for a fleeting moment, all she can do is stare at Fang Yuan, her expression a volatile mix of disbelief, exasperation, and something darker—something primal.

Fang Yuan, ever the embodiment of theatrical mischief, smirks with an air of triumph, his dark eyes gleaming with unbridled amusement as he watches her unravel before him. He leans back casually, crossing his arms over his chest, every inch of him radiating satisfaction. His smirk grows sharper, more insufferable by the second, as if savoring the chaos he has wrought.

“Speechless?” he taunts, his voice dripping with mock concern, yet laced with venomous charm. “Oh no, my dear maid! Have I finally rendered you mute? What a tragedy! The heavens themselves would weep to see such fiery passion silenced!”

Gu Xianer, seated quietly beside him, tilts her head in innocent confusion. She glances between Gu Wang and Fang Yuan, her wide eyes brimming with curiosity. “Big Sister Wang,” she murmurs softly, tugging gently on Gu Wang’s sleeve, “why are you angry? Did Brother say something wrong?”

The sound of Xianer’s voice snaps Gu Wang out of her daze, but only enough to unleash the storm within her. Her glare pierces through Fang Yuan like a blade forged from pure fury. “Wrong?! WRONG DOESN’T EVEN BEGIN TO COVER IT!” she explodes, her voice shaking with unrestrained rage. She throws her hands up in frustration, her entire body trembling with the force of her indignation. “Your brother isn’t just wrong—he’s INSANE! COMPLETELY, UTTERLY MAD!”

Fang Yuan gasps dramatically, clutching his chest as though struck by an invisible arrow. “Insane? Madness? Such cruel words from someone who claims to care about me!” His tone shifts abruptly, becoming teasingly sweet, almost saccharine. “Or perhaps… perhaps this anger is merely a mask for your true feelings?”

Gu Wang’s breath catches—though not from embarrassment, but pure, unfiltered indignation. Her face flushes, her hands balling into trembling fists. “A mask?! If I have any ‘true feelings’ toward you, they involve tying you to a tree and letting the wolves decide your fate!”

Fang Yuan chuckles, clearly reveling in her outrage. “Ah, how romantic! A love story filled with danger and adventure! But alas,” he sighs theatrically, placing a hand over his forehead as if overcome with emotion, “But alas, dear Gu Wang, I fear the wolves would bow before me. After all, even beasts recognize greatness when they see it.”

Gu Wang’s jaw drops, her patience shattering like glass under pressure. “That’s IT!” she screams, lunging forward with startling speed. Her hands reach out as if to strangle him—or at least shake some sense into him—but before she can make contact, Fang Yuan deftly sidesteps, dodging her attack with infuriating ease.

“Oh ho ho!” he laughs, dancing just out of her reach. “Such violence! Such ferocity! Truly, you’re proving my point more and more.”

“What point?! WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT?!” Gu Wang demands, spinning around to face him again. Her movements are fueled by raw frustration, but Fang Yuan continues to evade her effortlessly, his grin widening with each failed attempt.

Fang Yuan stops mid-step, his expression turning strangely soft yet still wickedly amused. “That you’re absolutely adorable when you’re angry,” he purrs. “Like a tiny cute harmless kitten trying to roar to intimidate.”

“I AM NOT A KITTEN!” Gu Wang roars—only to realize too late that she’s lunging again.

This time, Fang Yuan doesn’t dodge. He catches her wrists in one swift, deliberate motion, pulling her forward with just enough force to throw her balance off. The space between them vanishes in an instant—so close that she can feel the warmth of his breath against her skin.

Everything stops.

Gu Wang freezes, her breath hitching, her mind blanking as an unfamiliar heat spreads through her chest. Fang Yuan’s smirk softens, just slightly, his dark eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that steals the air from her lungs. For a heartbeat, the room vanishes, the sounds of clinking bowls and murmuring voices fading into nothing but their uneven breaths.

“You know,” he murmurs, his voice low and teasing, “if you wanted to get closer, you could’ve just asked.”

Gu Wang jerks away so fast she nearly stumbles, her face burning hotter than a forge. “Don’t flatter yourself!” she snaps, yanking her arms back, her entire body rigid with disbelief at her own reaction. “And stop acting like everything is a damn game!”

Fang Yuan places a hand over his heart, feigning deep offense. “A game? Me? Oh, Gu Wang, you wound me!” He lets out an exaggerated sigh, then turns to Gu Xianer, as if seeking support. “Xianer, tell her! Everything I do is out of pure, boundless affection.”

Gu Xianer, oblivious to the war raging between them, nods enthusiastically. “Yes! Brother loves everyone very much!”

Gu Wang lets out a strangled groan, dragging her hands down her face as if physically trying to scrape away her frustration. “Why me?” she mutters, slumping as if the weight of the universe has settled on her shoulders. “Why did I have to end up with someone like you…”

Fang Yuan grins, clearly interpreting her muttered complaint as a declaration of undying devotion. “Because fate brought us together, my dear maid,” he declares, striking a dramatic pose. “And fate always knows best. And I am the writer of fate. Ha ha ha.”

Gu Wang stands there, unmoving. Then, after a long silence, she exhales, slow and deep. Without another word or glance at Fang Yuan, she quietly sits down and begins eating her meal.

Her mind has collapsed.

The world no longer makes sense.

Her only thought?

**If this continues, I will lose my mind.**
