The room is tense—too tense—until Fang Yuan suddenly bursts into motion, slamming his hand on the table with a force that nearly sends it tumbling over. His expression shifts in an instant from unreadable to something far more alarming: madness. The kind of madness that makes you question whether he’s about to laugh or cry—or maybe both at the same time.

"Everyone, hear me out!" he shouts, his voice booming with a strange, intense gravity that fills the room. "I’m about to announce something so monumental that the heavens themselves might tremble!"

Gu Wang stands frozen, her brow furrowed in disbelief. She can’t tell if he’s joking or if he’s truly gone insane—again.

"Gu Wang!" Fang Yuan shouts, eyes blazing with energy as he locks his gaze on her. He’s serious now, utterly serious—or at least, that’s what it seems like. "You are now my maid!"

A heavy silence hangs in the air.

Gu Wang blinks. Her face flickers between confusion, anger, and... disbelief? This has to be a joke. No one would actually say something like that, right?

Fang Yuan continues, his voice a mixture of manic glee and sheer self-importance. "Do you understand, Gu Wang? You are about to be blessed by the GREAT LOVE DEMON VENERABLE! Oh, yes!" His eyes widen, an unhinged grin spreading across his face.

"It is an honor! A HUUUGE honor! I’m talking about divine honor here, you should be trembling in gratitude, HA HA HA!"

Gu Wang glares at him, arms crossed in front of her chest. "You think I’ll be proud to be your maid? Is this some twisted joke to you?"

Fang Yuan ignores her incredulity, his gaze distant, as if he’s already imagining the future. "Of course, you’ll be proud. You’ll be the envy of every woman in the world. Do you know what it means to be by the side of the GREAT LOVE DEMON VENERABLE?" He pauses, eyes wide with self-amusement, his voice dropping to a dramatic whisper. "It means every other girl will secretly want to be in your shoes. You will be the one they envy. HA HA HA!"

Gu Wang’s patience wears thin. "This is ridiculous, Fang Yuan. What are you even talking about?"

Fang Yuan’s grin widens, but then something snaps, his voice changing instantly from over-the-top arrogance to something darker. The transition is almost disturbing, his face tightening with a sudden seriousness that feels unnatural.

"Two reasons," he says, his tone low and heavy, but his eyes still wild with excitement. "First, you’re beautiful. That’s obvious."

Gu Wang opens her mouth to protest, but Fang Yuan raises his hand dramatically. "Wait, wait, wait. Don’t interrupt! The second reason... Well... you look so damn cute when you’re angry. Seriously! You’ve got this fiery little temper, and I just can’t get enough of it! HA HA HA!"

Gu Wang stares at him, her brain struggling to process what he's saying. "What are you—"

"No, NO! Let me finish! The real reason, Gu Wang, is that you’re so damn precious to me. You've become so close to my sister, and you both deserve each other! I can’t let that go! I won’t! I’ll tie you both down with my love, HA HA HA!"

His laughter echoes, manic and unpredictable, as though he's enjoying some private joke no one else can understand. He suddenly stops, though, his face warping with pain—sharp, sudden, gut-wrenching pain that cuts through his playful madness.

"The real reason... Is this," he says, his voice now strangely hollow, the usual madness fading just a touch. "I killed you... and your whole family... in my past life."

Gu Wang freezes, her heart hammering in her chest. She takes a step back, almost stumbling. "What... What are you saying?" Her voice quivers with uncertainty.

Fang Yuan looks at her as if she’s the one who’s lost her mind. "Oh, I know. This sounds insane, right? HA HA HA!" His laughter erupts again, completely unhinged. "I know! It’s crazy! But, hey, who else is going to tell you the truth? You’re standing here, looking all serious, thinking I’m making up some dark past. But no, I did kill you all. And now I’m here, making amends. Do you see? DO YOU SEE THE LOVE I HAVE FOR YOU?"

Gu Wang stares at him, still trying to process the utter absurdity of his words. "Are you serious? You’re telling me you’re doing this out of guilt?"

Fang Yuan’s expression suddenly flickers with mock sorrow. "Yes! Yes, Gu Wang, I am! Isn’t that beautiful? The Great Love Demon Venerable is here, sacrificing everything just to make you my maid! HA HA HA!"

He gestures grandly, as though announcing his own martyrdom. The insanity in his voice is unmistakable, but there’s something disturbingly genuine behind it.

"But wait!" He leans forward, suddenly intense again, eyes wide. "Don’t you see? This love? It’s deeper than anything you can understand. I was broken, worse than death, and now I’m trying to make it right!"

He pauses, looking at her with something almost desperate in his eyes. "Do you think Gu Xianer’s love for me is fake? Do you think my love for her is fake? Do you think this whole crazy mess is some random coincidence? HUH?!"

Gu Wang recoils, thrown by his outburst. She stares at him, uncertain of how to respond to the emotional roller coaster he’s dragging her through.

Fang Yuan’s voice softens, growing more tender despite his previous madness. "Just look at me, Gu Wang... Did you forget? Did you forget how broken I was?" His words hang in the air, a strange tension between them.

Gu Wang pauses. Her heart beats loudly in her chest. She takes in a slow breath, considering everything—Fang Yuan’s madness, his words, his confusion. And somewhere deep within her, she sees the madness for what it is: a raw, unfiltered truth. Even if it’s a distorted truth, it’s still real.

She takes a step forward, resolve forming in her chest. "Fine," she says, her voice steady. "I’ll be your maid. But I swear, Fang Yuan, you’ve gone insane. If this is your way of showing love, I don’t want to know what happens next."

Fang Yuan stares at her with wild eyes. Then, just as quickly, his grin returns, the madness twisting again in his expression. "HA HA HA! You have NO idea what you’re in for, Gu Wang!"

And with that, the chaos begins anew, swirling around them, unpredictable, like a storm that never ends.

---
The morning sun hasn’t fully awakened, its light still weak and uncertain. A dull gray mist clings to the village, and in the quiet of dawn, Gu Yue Bo sits frozen in his chambers, drenched in cold sweat. His hands tremble, his breath comes in short, ragged bursts.

That dream—no, that nightmare—refuses to leave his mind. The agony. The deaths. His own bodies, stacked upon one another, writhing, bleeding, suffering. The image is burned into him, raw and vivid, as if he had truly lived through it.

Was it real? No. It couldn't be.

Yet—

A thought burrows into his mind like a worm. If it was just a dream… why does his body feel like it remembers the pain?

His body still remembers the suffocating agony of dying over and over again, his own hands clawing at his throat, his own blood soaking the ground beneath him. His eyes squeeze shut, but the images burn behind his eyelids. The _smile_—Fang Yuan’s calm, childlike curiosity as he flicked the rocks, one after another, watching him suffer as if it were a game.

_"Don't be late."_

His stomach churns. A suffocating pressure crushes his chest, making it impossible to breathe properly.

Gu Yue Bo forces himself up, his legs heavy as lead, and orders a servant to take him to Fang Yuan's uncle’s house.

When he arrives, chaos fills the air. Servants rush back and forth, their faces pale, their voices sharp with barely contained hysteria.

A cold sensation grips his spine.

He stops one of them. “What’s going on?” His voice is hoarse.

The servant bows hastily, his face ghostly white. “Young Master Fang Yuan and Mistress Gu Xianer went to the market yesterday, but they haven’t returned! We’ve searched everywhere—there’s no sign of them!”

His heart _stops_.

A chill rushes down his spine.

The dream…

No. No, no, no—

This isn’t happening. It can’t be happening.

His breathing quickens. The sweat on his back turns cold.

Then—

His heart stops.

Fang Yuan’s voice, echoing from the dream.

The command.

_"Come find me."_

_"Punish me."_

_"Don't be late."_

His mind collapses in on itself. The world around him fades.

This is real.

It’s all real.

His stomach clenches with unbearable nausea.

He _knows_ where to go.

But every step drags him deeper into an abyss.

A shudder wracks his body. That was a dream. A nightmare. But if Fang Yuan is missing… if Gu Xianer is missing…

He stumbles back, nearly tripping over his own feet. His mind races. He needs to be sure.

He needs to go there.

The place from the dream.

His body moves before he can think. His steps are unsteady, but he forces himself forward, deeper into the wilderness. The trees stretch above him, their shadows long and ominous. The scent of damp earth fills his nostrils. And then—

The forest is silent.

No birds. No wind. No life.

Just an overwhelming stillness.

Then—

A smell.

Thick. Coppery.

Blood.

A thick, coppery scent clings to the air, dense and suffocating.

His stomach churns.

His breath hitches. His skin prickles.

A few steps more—

And then he _sees_.

Two men.

Writhing, twitching on the ground.

Their hands claw at their own throats, fingers trembling violently, mouths gaping in silent screams, eyes bulging from their sockets.

Blood seeps from their wounds—deep, precise, _unnatural_.

The rocks—_mere rocks_—pierced them with such exactness that they are neither dead nor alive, trapped in an endless cycle of suffering, the life slowly draining from their twitching bodies.

Gu Yue Bo stares, his body locking up.

His mind _shatters_.

His vision tunnels. His ears ring. His legs nearly give out beneath him.

This is—

The _same_.

The _exact_ same.

His own bodies. His own suffering.

The dream.

The nightmare.

No. No, no, no, _no_—

His breath turns into short, panicked gasps. He stumbles back, his heart hammering, his throat tightening as though an invisible hand is closing around it.

His fingers dig into his chest, desperately trying to steady his frantic heartbeat.

This… this shouldn’t be possible.

No, this is… impossible.

A rock. Their throats—pierced. A wound so precise, so measured, that it didn’t kill instantly but left them trapped between life and death.

Gu Yue Bo’s breath comes in short, shallow bursts. His hands tremble violently. His stomach lurches. His body rejects the sight, but his eyes refuse to tear away.

He has seen cruelty. He has seen men torn apart, butchered, slaughtered.

But this?

This is _something else entirely_.

It is not just murder. It is not just torture.

It is _perfection_, calculated cruelty. A horror crafted with purpose.

Each strike—each throw—_deliberate_. _Calculated_.

Every wound inflicted in the _exact_ same manner.

This is not human.

This is something _beyond human_.

His stomach turns. He stumbles back, but his legs feel like they belong to someone else.

The memory of Fang Yuan’s voice resurfaces.

_"Unless… you want to see yourself like this again."_

He swallows hard.

His body shakes. He’s seen cruelty before. But this—this is different. This isn’t the work of a human.

It’s something beyond.

His fingers clench into fists.

And yet, he forces himself forward.

Following the blood trail.

Each step feels heavier. The scent of blood thickens. The air grows colder.

And then—

He enters the cave.

His vision blurs.

He freezes.

His breath halts.

His chest tightens as if an invisible hand is squeezing his heart.

Inside—

Agony.

Agony made manifest.

The bandits. Their bodies scattered, twisted in torment, each of them clutching their throats, their faces frozen in silent screams. The blood pools beneath them, a dark reflection of his own suffering in the dream.

A perfect _replica_ of what he saw in the dream.

No—

Not a replica.

It’s the same.

Exactly the same.

A _reality_.

Gu Yue Bo’s breath catches in his throat. His vision tunnels. His heart pounds against his ribs, a frantic, desperate rhythm—too fast, too loud, yet utterly powerless against the silence that has swallowed the cave.

His knees buckle.

A wave of nausea crashes into him, drowning his senses, crushing the air from his lungs. His mind refuses to process what he’s seeing—what he _knows_ to be real. His body lurches, his legs giving out beneath him.

He collapses.

His weight sinks into the cold, slick ground, but he barely feels it. His hands, trembling violently, land in something warm and thick. The scent of iron surges up, suffocating, relentless, forcing its way down his throat until he can _taste_ it.

Blood.

So much blood.

It clings to him, seeps into his skin, wraps around his fingers like a grasping hand pulling him under. His chest heaves, but no air reaches his lungs. The cave walls seem to close in, the twisted bodies blurring together in a grotesque, nightmarish tableau.

His mind shatters.

A choked, broken sound escapes his lips. His limbs are weak, drained of all strength, as if the sheer horror of the scene has hollowed him out from the inside. His thoughts slip through his fingers like sand, unraveling, scattering into nothingness.

This isn’t just a massacre.

This isn’t just cruelty.

This is something _else_.

Something that should not exist.

His vision darkens at the edges. His body spasms once—twice—before going utterly still.

And then, silence.

Gu Yue Bo lies motionless, swallowed by the calculated cruelty.
