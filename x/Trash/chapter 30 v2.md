A **deep silence** suffocates the small wooden house, pressing down like an unseen force, as if the very air itself is afraid to stir. The dim light flickers against the wooden walls, yet it does nothing to warm the frozen hearts inside.

Outside, **Fang Yuan’s laughter lingers**, a twisted melody of amusement and madness. **Soft. Distant. Yet inescapable.** A reminder that his presence does not need to be near to be felt.

Old Man Wang **clutches his wooden staff**, his knuckles white, his fingers trembling against the rough grain. **Sweat beads** on his wrinkled forehead, sliding down his temples in slow, uneasy trails. His breath is shallow—**the breathing of a man who has stared death in the face and realized that even survival is a curse.**

Wang Er **stands motionless, silent as stone.** His fists are clenched so tightly that his nails have dug into his palms, red crescents marking his skin. His head is bowed, **his shoulders stiff, his body coiled—not in defiance, but in fear so deep it has swallowed him whole.**

Only **Gu Wang speaks.**

Her voice is the only thing that dares to move in this deadened space, burning with **frustration, disbelief… and defiance.**

"**You both saw what happened, didn’t you?!**"

Her gaze **cuts through them**, sharp, demanding, furious.

"**I can see it. The way you’re both shaking. The way you’re too scared to even LOOK at me properly!**"

No answer.

They stand there, still and **silent**, as if their voices have been stolen.

Gu Wang **takes a step forward**, her breath unsteady, but her anger steady.

"**Say something! Are you really going to let that lunatic take me as his maid?! Have you lost all sense?! And why are you trembling now? He isn’t even here!**"

Still, **no response.**

Old Man Wang **shuts his eyes**, inhaling deeply—**but the air does nothing to ease his trembling.**

Then, finally—**his voice, hoarse, barely above a whisper.**

"**Gu Wang… we don’t have a choice.**"

Gu Wang **stiffens.**

"**No choice?**"

Her voice wavers, but not from fear—from **rage.**

"**NO CHOICE?!**"

She **steps closer**, fists clenched, her body trembling with the weight of betrayal.

"**Father, my whole life, you’ve told me that we should never surrender, never bow down to the powerful, never abandon our own will! And now?! NOW YOU’RE HANDING ME OVER WITHOUT A FIGHT?!**"

Her **breath hitches.**

"**I agreed to go, but deep down, I thought—I thought you’d stop me. I thought at least YOU would stand against this madness!**"

Old Man Wang **winces.**

But **he does not argue.**

And that silence—that unbearable, suffocating silence—**is worse than any words.**

Gu Wang **feels something in her chest twist painfully.**

Her gaze snaps to **Wang Er.**

"**And YOU!**"

Wang Er **flinches.**

"**You’ve been standing there like a ghost! Say something! Do you actually WANT to follow that lunatic?! WHERE IS YOUR COURAGE?! HOW CAN YOU JUST LET YOUR SISTER GO?!**"

Wang Er’s **shoulders tense.**

But still, **he does not speak.**

For the first time, **Gu Wang realizes something is wrong.**

His hands **aren’t just clenched in anger.**

They are **shaking.**

"**Wang Er.**"

Her voice lowers.

"**Say something. Please.**"

Slowly—**too slowly**—he lifts his head.

And **Gu Wang’s breath catches.**

His eyes… **they are empty.**

Not cold. Not angry. **Just… empty.**

Then, **his lips part.**

"**I don’t want to die.**"

Gu Wang **freezes.**

The words **are whispered, barely breathed—but they shatter something in her.**

"**What…?**"

Wang Er **closes his eyes, shaking his head.**

Then, **he speaks again.**

"**I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die like those bandits. NO. NO!**"

His voice **cracks**, his body **trembles violently.**

Gu Wang **takes a step back.**

Something **cold and sharp slithers into her spine.**

She has never seen Wang Er afraid.

Not like this.

"**What are you talking about? Have you also gone mad?!**"

"**Gu Wang.**"

A voice **cuts through the room.**

**Old Man Wang.**

Gu Wang **turns sharply**, ready to argue—**but the words never leave her lips.**

Her father… **his face.**

She has never seen him like this before.

His **eyes, sunken, dark.**

His **skin, pale as a corpse.**

Not worried.

Not tired.

Just… **broken.**

Then, **he speaks.**

"**You didn’t see what we saw.**"

His **voice is hollow.**

"**You think only he is mad? That he is the only demon?**"

A breath.

A **shuddering, pained breath.**

"**His sister is worse.**"

Gu Wang’s **stomach twists.**

She shakes her head.

"**No. No, Xianer is—**"

"**You weren’t there.**"

Wang Er’s voice **cuts in.**

He lifts his trembling hands as if to **grasp onto something—anything—to hold himself together.**

"**You didn’t see what we saw.**"

He **swallows dryly.**

"**She was crying. Holding her brother's body. Sobbing.**"

His voice **drops to a whisper.**

"**But she was sitting in a pool of blood.**"

Gu Wang **stiffens.**

Wang Er’s **eyes darken.**

"**And the bandits… were still alive.**"

Silence.

A **horrible, breath-stealing silence.**

Then—**Old Man Wang speaks again.**

"**And that was not the worst thing I saw.**"

Gu Wang **turns to him slowly.**

"**Father…?**"

His grip on his staff **tightens painfully.**

"**He made me see it, Gu Wang.**"

His voice **shakes.**

"**The past. Our deaths.**"

Gu Wang **doesn’t move.**

She doesn’t even breathe.

"**I saw Wang Er die first. I saw myself kneel and beg. I saw you… screaming, fighting back, refusing to give in.**"

His **breath trembles.**

"**And I saw him kill us all. One by one.**"

Gu Wang **feels like the floor beneath her has vanished.**

She wants to **deny it.**

Wants to **call it nonsense.**

But… the fear in their eyes…

It’s too **real.**

Old Man Wang **lets out a long, pained breath.**

"**They are terrifying. Too cruel. Too merciless.**"

His **eyes darken.**

"**To them… our deaths were nothing.**"

Gu Wang **clenches her fists.**

Her body **shakes.**

Then—**she lifts her head.**

"**You’re wrong about Gu Xianer.**"

Her voice is **firm, unwavering.**

"**She’s not a monster. She’s pure. I’ve seen it. I’ve seen her love, her devotion, her sorrow, and her pain. She is too kind for this world.**"

Old Man Wang **closes his eyes.**

"**Then let’s pray you’re right.**"

A long silence.

Then—**a final breath.**

"**We have no choice. You will go as his maid. Wang Er as his servant.**"

Gu Wang **stares.**

Then—**her fists tighten.**

"**I’m not going because of him.**"

Her voice **is steel.**

"**I’m going because of her.**"

Her eyes burn with **resolve.**

"**Because Gu Xianer is too pure, too innocent for this world.**"

Her voice lowers into a whisper.

"**And if no one else will protect her… then I will.**"
