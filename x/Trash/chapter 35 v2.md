The sun hung high in the sky, its golden rays spilling through the windows like molten fire, bathing the room in a radiant warmth. The heat was alive, wrapping itself around Gu Xianer and Gu Wang as they stirred from their slumber. But it wasn’t just the sun’s warmth that filled the air—it was something softer, more tender. A quiet, unspoken bond of love and care lingered between them, binding them together in this fleeting moment of peace.

Nearby, Fang Yuan stood with an aura both commanding and gentle, like the calm before a storm. With infinite patience, he reached for Gu Xianer, lifting her into his arms as though she were made of glass—delicate, precious, irreplaceable. Still drowsy, she nestled against him, her small frame enveloped by his protective embrace. Her trust in him was absolute, so pure it could move mountains. Behind them, Gu Wang watched silently, her sharp eyes catching every detail—the way Fang Yuan’s fingers curled slightly tighter around Gu Xianer’s back, the faint softening of his usually unreadable expression, the unspoken connection that tethered the siblings together like threads of fate.

Once they had freshened up, Fang Yuan’s voice broke the serene stillness, smooth and teasing yet laced with an authority that brooked no argument. “Both of you,” he drawled lazily, his tone dripping with playful command, “go and bring our lunch.”

Gu Xianer’s face lit up instantly, her large eyes sparkling with unrestrained delight. She turned to Gu Wang, grabbing her hand with childlike enthusiasm, practically dragging her toward the servants’ quarters. Each step felt like a dance, her energy infectious, her joy boundless. To her, retrieving lunch wasn’t merely a task—it was an adventure, a chance to share in the simple pleasures of life. Her laughter echoed softly in the corridor, light and melodic, filling the space with an innocence that seemed otherworldly.

When they arrived at the servants’ quarters, the atmosphere shifted abruptly. The bustling activity froze mid-motion, the servants stiffening like statues under some unseen force. Their faces paled, hands trembling ever so slightly as they scrambled to present dish after dish—far more food than either girl had asked for or even anticipated. Plates piled high with steaming delicacies, fragrant aromas wafting through the air, creating a feast fit for royalty.

Gu Xianer blinked in confusion, tilting her head like a curious bird. “Huh?” she murmured, her voice tinged with wonder. “The servants seem to really like you, Gu Wang! They gave us so much more food than last time.”

Gu Wang hesitated, glancing at the servants, whose rigid postures betrayed their fear. Their expressions were carefully blank, masks worn to conceal the turmoil beneath. For a fleeting moment, Gu Wang wondered what horrors these people had witnessed—or imagined—to make them act this way. But she said nothing, choosing instead to focus on Gu Xianer. Quietly, almost hesitantly, she asked, “Why aren’t you taking another plate for your brother? Won’t he eat?”

A soft, dreamy smile spread across Gu Xianer’s lips, transforming her already angelic features into something ethereal. She clutched the tray close to her chest, her voice carrying a warmth so pure it sent a pang through Gu Wang’s heart. “He will feed me,” she replied simply, her words infused with unwavering certainty. “And he’ll eat with me while telling me stories.”

Gu Wang stopped dead in her tracks, her breath hitching in her throat. Her mind reeled, struggling to process the weight of those words. “He… he feeds you?” she stammered, disbelief coloring her tone. “Since when?”

Gu Xianer tilted her head thoughtfully, as if reaching for a memory buried deep within the recesses of her mind. “For as long as I can remember,” she answered softly, her voice carrying the same innocence and simplicity as always.

Gu Wang fell silent, her thoughts spiraling into chaos. A strange sensation swirled within her chest, twisting and tightening until it became almost unbearable. It wasn’t jealousy, nor was it anger—it was something deeper, more profound. A mixture of awe, envy, and a bittersweet longing she couldn’t quite name. She stared at Gu Xianer, who carried the tray with such ease, such blind faith, such unconditional trust. There was no hesitation, no doubt in her actions—only love. Pure, unshakable love.

In that moment, Gu Wang understood.

This was not mere affection. This was devotion. This was a bond forged in the fires of hardship and tempered by years of shared pain and joy. It was love in its rawest, most primal form—unconditional, selfless, and utterly consuming. It was a connection so deep, so intrinsic, that it transcended words, defied logic, and left no room for doubt.

And as she watched Gu Xianer skip ahead, humming softly to herself, Gu Wang realized that this love was not just a part of who they were—it _was_ who they were.

Gu Xianer came running up to Fang Yuan, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “Brother! Look!” she exclaimed, holding up a plate piled high with food. The portion was generous, almost overwhelming—clearly, they had been given the finest cuts, far more than usual. “Today they gave us so much! See this big piece? It’s like they really like Gu Wang. They gave us all the best parts!”

Gu Wang frowned slightly, shaking her head in quiet denial. “No, no, it’s not because of me,” she muttered, though her cheeks flushed faintly under Gu Xianer’s enthusiastic praise. She glanced away, clearly uncomfortable with the attention.

Fang Yuan chuckled softly, his tone teasing as he leaned back casually, his presence both commanding and playful. “Haven’t I told you?” he said, gesturing dramatically toward Gu Wang. “She’s my eternal maid. How could my maid _not_ bring fortune? Just by looking at her pretty face, people are compelled to give us better food. Ha ha ha!”

Gu Wang’s expression shifted from embarrassment to frustration, her fists clenching tightly at her sides. “Stop saying ridiculous things!” she snapped, glaring at him. But before she could say anything else, Fang Yuan turned his attention back to Gu Xianer, his demeanor softening instantly, as if nothing else mattered but the girl before him.

“Alright, my angel,” he murmured warmly, picking up a morsel of food with his fingers. His movements were deliberate, gentle, as though handling something precious. “Open wide.”

Gu Xianer giggled, leaning forward obediently as Fang Yuan fed her. The moment was tender, almost impossibly sweet—his careful gestures, her delighted laughter, the way their bond seemed unshakable. Watching them, Gu Wang felt an unexpected pang in her chest. For a fleeting second, she imagined herself in a similar scenario, being fed by Fang Yuan. Her cheeks reddened further at the thought, and she quickly shook her head to clear it.

Suddenly, Fang Yuan glanced over at Gu Wang, a mischievous glint lighting up his eyes. “What about you, my dear maid?” he teased, tilting his head playfully. “Do you want me to feed you too?”

Gu Wang froze, her face turning an even brighter shade of red. “N-No!” she stammered, crossing her arms defensively. “I would never let you feed me!”

Fang Yuan smirked, clearly reveling in her reaction. “Even if you wanted, I wouldn’t feed you,” he replied smoothly, his voice dripping with mock disappointment. “This privilege is reserved exclusively for my cute, angelic, adorable little sister.” He patted Gu Xianer’s head affectionately, earning another giggle from her. “As for you, maid,” he continued, pointing at Gu Wang with exaggerated authority, “it’s your duty to feed _me_ . Ha ha ha! So get ready—you’ll be serving me every meal from now on.”

Gu Wang stared at him, torn between outrage and disbelief. “You’re impossible!” she finally burst out, throwing her hands up in exasperation. But despite her words, there was a flicker of amusement in her eyes, betraying how much she had grown accustomed to his antics—and perhaps, how deeply she cared for the chaos he brought into their lives.

Just then, Gu Xianer tugged gently on Fang Yuan’s sleeve, her large eyes filled with curiosity. “Brother,” she began shyly, “why don’t you tell me a story? I want to hear a new one.”

Fang Yuan paused, considering her request for a moment. Then, with a fond smile that softened the sharp edges of his personality, he nodded. “Of course, my sweet Xianer,” he said, settling into a comfortable position. “Let me think of something truly special for you…”
