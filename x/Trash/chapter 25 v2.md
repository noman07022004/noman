But Fang Yuan isn’t listening. His gaze slowly turns, like a storm cloud shifting in the sky, and lands on Gu Xianer with an expression so tender it could melt steel—or at least confuse it into submission.

"Gu Xianer…" he murmurs, his voice dripping with faux-seriousness, as if he’s about to deliver the most profound philosophical truth known to mankind. "What about _you_ ?"

Gu Xianer blinks, her innocent eyes wide and unblinking. “…Brother?”

Fang Yuan takes a slow, exaggerated breath, as though preparing himself for battle—or maybe just savoring the suspense of whatever absurdity is about to come out of his mouth next.

And then—

His grin stretches unnaturally across his face, his teeth gleaming like polished pearls under the dim light. His eyes glint with something between mischief and madness, like a fox who has just discovered how to open every chicken coop in the village.

"But you, Gu Xianer…" he says, his tone dropping into a low, theatrical whisper that somehow manages to sound both menacing and ridiculous at the same time. He steps closer, each movement deliberate, as if stalking his prey—or perhaps testing whether she’ll run screaming before he can fully unleash his chaos.

"You and I…" he continues, his voice rising slightly, filled with mock gravitas. "We are siblings."

Gu Xianer nods hesitantly, clearly unsure where this is going but too polite (or too terrified) to interrupt. “Y-Yes?”

"And siblings…" Fang Yuan pauses dramatically, leaning forward until their faces are almost touching. His breath tickles her cheek as he whispers conspiratorially, "...always fight."

Without thinking, Gu Xianer nods again, her confusion deepening. “Yes?”

Fang Yuan throws his arms wide, as if addressing an invisible audience of thousands. His voice booms like thunder, echoing off the walls with unhinged enthusiasm.

"It is fate! It is cosmic law! If we do not fight, the universe itself will unravel! The skies will crack, the rivers will boil, and the gods themselves will descend from heaven to smite us for our failure!"

He spins around wildly, pointing at random objects in the room as if they’re evidence of impending doom. "Do you see that table? That chair? Even _they_ know what must happen! The very fabric of reality demands it!"

Gu Xianer stares, her tiny hands clutching the hem of her dress. She hesitates, but there’s a flicker of determination in her eyes. “...Brother, if you want this, I will do it.”

Before anyone can process what’s happening, Gu Wang explodes.

"WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE IS THAT, YOU LUNATIC?! ARE YOU TRYING TO DESTROY MY FAMILY’S SANITY ALONG WITH YOUR OWN?!"

But Fang Yuan doesn’t even glance in her direction. Instead, he points at Gu Xianer like a general rallying his troops for war, his expression radiating divine purpose.

“GU XIANER!” he bellows, his voice shaking the very foundations of the house. “ARE YOU READY TO FULFILL YOUR SACRED DUTY AND SHOW THE WORLD THE TRUE MEANING OF SIBLING LOVE THROUGH BATTLE?!”

Gu Xianer, ever the obedient little sister, clenches her fists and shouts back with earnest determination, “Brother! I may not be strong, but I promise I will try my best!”

Gu Wang’s jaw drops so far it nearly hits the floor. Her soul seems to leave her body entirely, floating somewhere near the ceiling as she watches the scene unfold below.

WHAT. WHAT. WHAT?!

She watches in utter disbelief as Fang Yuan charges forward, moving with the speed and ferocity of a warrior facing down an army of demons. His steps are heavy, his intent unreadable, his presence overwhelming.

No. This isn’t a joke anymore. He’s serious.

Gu Xianer trembles, but she stands her ground. Though her hands shake, her face is set with unwavering resolve.

This is her duty.

Fang Yuan moves like lightning. His arms lunge forward with terrifying force, as if he’s about to crush Gu Xianer’s head between his palms—or perhaps rip the earth apart with sheer willpower.

Gu Xianer’s eyes shut tightly in fear, bracing herself for impact.

Gu Wang freezes, unable to move, as if the very air has been sucked from her lungs. The tension in the room is suffocating—deadly serious, as if a real battle is unfolding. One must fall. One must triumph.

And then—

Fang Yuan’s hands land gently on Gu Xianer’s cheeks.

He starts rubbing them.

Silence.

His eyes flutter shut in pure, absolute bliss. A contented sigh escapes his lips, soft and reverent, like a man who has found enlightenment in the most unexpected place.

“…SO. SOFT.” His voice trembles with ecstasy, each word spoken with the reverence of a poet describing the sunrise. “I CAN DIE FOR THIS.”

Everyone’s eyes snap open.

Gu Xianer blinks in confusion, tilting her head like a curious puppy. “Brother… aren’t you going to fulfill the sacred duty of siblings?”

Fang Yuan sighs dreamily, his hands still massaging her cheeks with alarming affection. His lips curl into a gentle, loving smile that somehow manages to look both tender and completely unhinged.

“…TOO MUCH CUTENESS.” His voice is a breathless whisper, barely audible over the sound of Gu Wang’s mental breakdown. “I CAN’T HANDLE IT.”

Gu Wang feels something inside her shatter. Her mind races, trying desperately to make sense of what she’s witnessing, but all she can think is:

WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY IS THIS MAN DOING?!

Her hand twitches, itching to punch him. No, scratch that—she needs to punch him. Right now. Before her brain melts into a puddle of incomprehension.

But before she can act, Fang Yuan’s expression suddenly darkens. His playful grin vanishes, replaced by a look of deadly resolve. His aura shifts—no longer playful, but grim. Cold. Unforgiving.

The air thickens.

For a moment—**just a moment—**Gu Wang believes him. Her lips part, and before she even realizes it, she shouts: "NO!"

Gu Xianer clenches her fists, readying herself.

Fang Yuan takes a deep breath, his tone solemn. “I am going to do my sacred duty. Are you ready?”

Everything stops.

Everything is serious.

Fang Yuan steps back. His eyes gleam with dangerous light, like a predator sizing up its prey one final time.

And then—he charges.

The world holds its breath.

Gu Xianer closes her eyes again, bracing herself.

The moment comes.

The impact—never arrives.

She slowly opens her eyes.

“…Brother?”

Fang Yuan is rubbing his cheek against hers.

After rubbing one side, he switches to the other.

And then back.

And then back again.

The process continues, methodical and unhurried, as if he’s performing some ancient ritual passed down through generations of lunatics.

Gu Wang’s breath catches in her throat. Her face twists in frustration so intense she feels like she might explode.

“…NO. NO. NO. I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS REALITY.”

Fang Yuan sighs contentedly, still rubbing. His voice is hushed, as if he is revealing a divine secret meant only for the chosen few.

“This…” He whispers dramatically, his eyes closed in rapture. “This is the sacred duty. Do you understand, Gu Xianer?”

Gu Xianer stares at him, then nods innocently. “Yes, Brother.”

Fang Yuan nods sagely, as if imparting wisdom to a disciple. “And only I can perform this duty. No one else.”

Gu Xianer nods again. “Okay, Brother.”

Then—she tilts her head, her curiosity piqued. “Then let me do my sacred duty too.”

Gu Wang loses it.

“STOP ENCOURAGING HER, YOU PSYCHOPATH!”

Fang Yuan bursts into manic laughter, clutching his sides as if the mere thought of such cuteness might physically harm him.

“SO CUTE! TOO CUTE! I’M GOING TO DIE! AHAHAHAHA!”

Then—Fang Yuan closes his eyes, leaning into the moment like a connoisseur savoring fine wine.

Gu Xianer gently rubs her cheek against his, mimicking his earlier movements with pure, innocent dedication. She switches sides, repeating the process with the same level of seriousness she would apply to any life-or-death task.

Finally, she pulls back, smiling brightly. “Brother, I have completed my sacred duty. I can do it every day if you want.”

Fang Yuan gasps, staggering back as if mortally wounded. He clutches his chest, his expression a perfect blend of awe and agony.

“NO! NO! I CAN’T TAKE THAT MUCH LOVE FROM MY SISTER AT ONCE! LET ME DIGEST FIRST, OR I WILL DIE FROM OVERDOSING ON SIBLING AFFECTION!”

Gu Xianer nods seriously, her tiny fists clenching with determination. “Then, Brother, please tell me when your digestion is finished. After that, I will again do my duty.”

Gu Wang collapses to her knees, clutching her head as if trying to hold her sanity together. Her entire body shakes with a mixture of rage, frustration, and sheer bewilderment.

“I CAN’T DO THIS. I CAN’T DO THIS. I’M GOING TO LOSE MY MIND.”

And in the background—

Fang Yuan throws his head back in maniacal laughter, tears streaming down his face as he revels in the absurdity of it all.

“HA HA HA HA HA HA! TOO CUTE! I AM GOING TO DIE! AHAHAHAHA!”
