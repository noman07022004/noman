After a few days,

During dinner, Uncle says with a gentle and satisfied smile, “I and your aunty are very happy about you. Fang Zheng, you have made us proud you have broken through to the rank 1 upper stage. And Gu Xianer, you have recently reached the rank 1 middle stage. We are proud of you.” After that, Uncle looks at Fang Yuan and then clears his throat and says with an artificial smile, “You have really worked hard. Even though you are a D-grade, you have reached rank 1 middle stage. You have really worked hard” Fang Yuan doesn’t reply but gives a small nod of approval while looking down at the table.

  “I and your aunt have been thinking about adopting you. We don’t have any children of our own. So, we always see you as our child. Now, we want to make it official.” Aunty adds, “Yes, your uncle and I have decided this. We want to become your real parents.”

Fang Zheng coughs and says with hesitation, “I also want to, but...” Uncle asks with a forceful smile, “What is it? Don’t hold back? Say it.” Fang Zheng responds, “Actually, Chi Chen and I are good friends. So a few days ago, he invited me to their house, and then his grand father gave me 100 primeval stones and also said that if I got myself adopted by Chi Faction, he would give me one time 1000 primeval stones as a celebratory bonus. And I will get 50 primeval stones as a weekly allowance.” After that incident, Mo Bei also invited me to his house, and his grandfather gave me 120 primeval stones and also said that if I got myself adopted by Mo Faction, he would give me one time 1200 primeval stones as a celebratory bonus, and I would get 60 primeval stones as a weekly allowance.” 

After a deep sigh, Fang Zheng adds, “I thought that if I and my sister got adopted by them, we could earn more than 2,000 primeval stones instantly, and we could also earn more than 100 primeval stones each week. We might not need that many primeval stones, but as our big brother is only a D grade talent, we need to support him. I thought that I and Gu Xianer would give half of our primeval stones to our big brother so that he could overcome his luck of talent.”

  

After saying that, Fang Zheng gives a bag of primeval stone to Fang Yuan and says, “Brother, this is for you. There are 70 primeval stones in this bag. It will help you in your cultivation. And take this, Gu Xianer. In this bag there are 50 primeval stones. It would also be helpful to you.” 

  

Fang Yuan tries to reject it, but Fang Zheng and Gu Xianer say, “Brother, take it. You have been taking good care of us since childhood. Now it is our time to take care of you.” Then Gu Xianer shouts with determination, “I want to be adopted by them. In this way, I could help my big brother.”

  

Aunt and uncle become stupified and cannot say a single thing. After a few breaths, Uncle says with a shaking voice, “I can also give you a weekly allowance and a bonus when you perform well in the exam.” Then, making a very sad and sorry face, Uncle adds, “I may not provide you that much, but I can provide you that much; that would be enough for your cultivation. You know, I might look selfish, but I and your aunt can’t live without you a single day. You are our children. We can’t even think about that you all would be adopted by someone else.” Suddenly, tears start pouring out of Uncle’s eyes, and then he says, “Even when I think about it. It feels like someone is taking away my heart. It feels so much empty that words can’t describe it.”

  

Aunty starts crying loudly and says, “When your parents died, I and your uncle took you as our children. Even though our financial situation was not that good, we always tried to provide you the best. I don’t have any children of mine. When I look at you, it always gives me happiness. I always think that you are my children. Now are you trying to go away? Are you trying to take away my children?”

  

Uncle adds while trembling, “You might think that your aunt and uncle give you only 5 primeval stones each week. You could only see the number, but you couldn’t see the love of your aunt and uncle that is mixed with those primeval stones. We were saving those primeval stones for your future. You will get those primeval stones and all our property in the future because we don’t have our own child.”

  

Suddenly, aunt screams while crying, “Who says we don’t have our children? Who are they then? They are my children. I won’t allow anyone to take them away from me.” While saying, she faints on the spot.

After sometime at aunt and uncle’s room, “You did a good job. I haven’t expected that from you. I always thought you were a brainless bitch.” 

Aunt responds, “What should we do now?” 

Uncle says, “You have to act as if you got so much mental shock and always try to act weak, unhealthy, and sick. I will give each of them 50 primeval stones each week. And then we will well show them that it is very hard for us to bear the expense, but we are determined to give our all. Do you understand?” 

"Ok, then I will kick out most of our servants after a few days, and I will not use any makeup for the time being.” 

Uncle responds with a bright smile, “Ha ha ha. You are really my wife. You have caught it quickly. In this way, we will show them we love them so much that we could sacrifice everything for them. I have calculated everything. Currently, we are earning more than 700 primeval stones each month, and I also have a lot of primeval stones in my stock. We only need to give them support for about 6 months. Afterward, they will be graduated and will complete the clan mission.”

Aunt responds, “In this way, we won’t have to give them their family inheritance, and they would be indebted to us.”

“Yes, their family inheritance is at least 50,000 primeval stones. We can’t lose it. You have to give them more emotional damage. You have to pay extra attention to Fang Yuan. I will give him 20 more primeval stones. If we could control him, Fang Zheng and Gu Xianer would be in our hands. Because Fang Zheng and Gu Xianer love their brother very much. I haven’t expected it.”

At the same time in Fang Zheng’s room, Fang Zheng is looking at the dark sky through windows standing before it. Today is the new moon night. Which makes it ghostly. Fang Zheng ponders while looking at the nonexistent moon, “Everything is going according to plan, but I haven’t expected my aunt and uncle to show me that much drama. They are thinking that I am in their hands, but in reality they are at paw. A few days ago, I manipulated Gu Yue Chi Chen and went to their house. Then, I talk alone with Chi Chen’s grandfather, Gu Yue Chi Lian. I told him that Chi Chen is only a C-grade talent, and you have faked it. He was thinking about killing me but couldn’t do it because of the circumstances. I took 1000 primeval stones from him, and I also told him that I am taking this as a tuition fee. I will teach Chi Chen, and we will become good brothers. So, he doesn’t need to worry.”

  

Then Fang Zheng sits on the bed and continues to think, "Afterward, I manipulated Gu Yue Mo Bei, and as a result, I was also summoned by his grandfather. I told him that Gu Yue Chi Chen’s grandfather gave me 100 primeval stones, and we had a good lunch; he also told me that I and Chi Chen could be real brothers. Hearing this, he also gave me 120 primeval stones and then told me that his grandson could also become my brother. When I was talking with him, I told him that I heard a lot about his granddaughter. She is really brave and beautiful. I even mentioned that I would marry a brave girl like her. At that time, she came into the room, and I pretended that I fell in love with her at first glance. While talking, I gave many hints, like blashing just by hearing her voice—too embarrassed to look at her, etc. Afterward, her father went out, giving an excuse. We talked and walked with each other for some time, and I gave her a lot of hints, and she also gave me some indirect signals. Afterward, when I was leaving, Gu Yue Mo Chen, the grandfather of Gu Yue Mo Bei, behaved very gently. He he he. Everything is going according to plan.”

  

Fang Zheng lays down on the bed and gives a satisfied smile and shouts in his heart with excitement, “I can’t stop but laugh, thinking about Yao Le, the successor of Medicine Hall. I got some minor injuries while exploring the inheritance of Flower Wine Monk. I went to the medicine hall and then pretend that I am in pain. They healed me. But when they were healing me, I told them that about me. After some days, I got injured and again went to the medicine hall. I continued this process for sometimes. I told them that I would marry a girl from the medicine hall. Whenever I got injured, my wife would gently heal me. And then I also pretend that it was a slip of the tongue, and I hurily rushed out so that they think I am embarrassed. On the way, I met the medicine hall’s successor, Yao Le. She became startled, as we had already met before but we hadn’t revealed our identity then. But I had known that this is the medicine hall’s successor, Yao Le. So, when we met in the market, I treated her very well and made a lot of co-incidence, like we met several times by luck in several places, but actually it was my crafted plan. Then I bought her some girl’s accessories, saying that she had to give me something if we met again. That is why she was startled and shocked.”

  

Then, giving a devilish smile, Fang Zheng shouts in his heart, “Chi faction, Mo faction, and Medicine Hall are the three main factions in Gu Yue Village. Now they are in my paw. Even from now on, my big brother and my little sister will be indebted to me for the kindness that I have shown them today. They can never think what will be waiting for them in the future. For the time being, I will stay low while solidifying my next plan. My next plan includes clan head Gu Yue Bo, my big brother Fang Yuan, my little sister Gu Xianer, merchant caravan owner Jia Fu, and his stupid brother Jia Jin Sheng. I have made a great plan for my big brother Fang Yuan and my cute little sister Gu Xianer. You two love each other so much. I will make you love practical. Ha ha ha. How good it would be to hear that the big brother, who loves his little sister very much, brutally raped her! I will execute this plan after buying some essential ingredients from the merchant caravan. He he he.” Fang Zheng’s sinister smile echos through the room, creating an eerie environment.
