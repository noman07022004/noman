A Nazi soldier returned home from the war on a short leave.

Traumatized by its horrors, he found comfort in his wife’s presence.

Feeling safe, he confided in her—he spoke out against Hitler.

Later, his wife quietly reported him to the Nazis.

He was arrested and sentenced to death.

After the fall of the Nazi regime, his wife was put on trial.

Her defense?

“I was just following the law.”

But the court discovered she had been having an affair—and used the system to get rid of her husband.

The court found her guilty—not for reporting him, but for abusing the law to serve her own ends.
