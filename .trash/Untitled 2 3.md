**Imagine coming back alive to your beloved wife from a deadly war. Feeling safe in her arms, you speak out against the dictator — only to later find yourself arrested and sentenced to death. This is what happened to a Nazi soldier.**

One day, a Nazi soldier returned home from the war on a short leave. He was deeply traumatized by its horrors. But feeling safe in his wife’s arms, he spoke out against Hitler. She comforted him — but later, she quietly reported him to the Nazis. He was arrested and sentenced to death.

After the fall of the Nazi regime, his wife was put on trial. In her defense, she claimed she had done nothing wrong — that she was merely following the law.  
But the court discovered that she had been having an affair while her husband was away at war, and had used the system to get rid of him.

The court declared her guilty — not for sending her husband to his death, but for abusing the law.

**Do you agree with the court’s reasoning?**
