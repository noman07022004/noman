Here's your script with guidance on **pauses (‖)**, **breath points (ʘ)**, and **intonation/emphasis suggestions** for effective voice-over delivery. I’ve added **[Voice Notes]** to help with tone and emotion:

---

**A Nazi soldier returned home from the war,** ‖ ʘ  
**traumatized** _(emphasize: show emotional weight)_, **but relieved to finally see his wife again.** ‖  
_[Voice Note: Gentle, slightly hopeful tone on “relieved to finally see his wife again.”]_

**Haunted by horrors,** ‖ ʘ  
**he spoke out against Hitler.** ‖  
**His wife comforted him.** ‖  
_[Voice Note: Soften tone on “comforted him.” Slow pacing here.]_

**Later,** ‖ _(pause for shift in tone)_  
**his wife quietly reported him to the Nazis.** ‖  
_[Voice Note: Cold, subtle suspicion. Add slight emphasis on “quietly.”]_

**He was arrested,** ‖  
**and during his trial,** ‖ ʘ  
**he was sentenced to death based on his wife’s testimony.** ‖  
_[Voice Note: Serious, heavier tone. Drop pitch slightly on “death.”]_

**After the fall of the Nazis,** ‖ ʘ  
**his wife was put on trial.** ‖  
_[Voice Note: Neutral but suspenseful. Controlled pace.]_

**Her defense was simple:** ‖ _(pause)_  
**“I was just following the law.”** ‖  
_[Voice Note: Use a slight mocking or dry tone here, quoting.]_

**But the court uncovered the truth:** ‖ ʘ  
**she hadn’t reported her husband out of loyalty to the law;** ‖  
**rather, she had been having an affair** _(slight emphasis)_  
**and used the system to get rid of her husband.** ‖  
_[Voice Note: Let the betrayal sink in. Slow down slightly.]_

**She was sentenced to imprisonment** ‖  
**not for reporting her husband to his death,** ‖  
**but for abusing the law.** ‖ ʘ  
_[Voice Note: Cold, final. Punch “abusing the law.”]_

**Do you agree with the court’s reasoning for punishing her?** ‖  
_[Voice Note: Shift tone to inquisitive. Slight rise in pitch at the end.]_
