A Nazi soldier returned home from the war for a short leave.

He was traumatized by the horrors of the war but felt safe and comfort in his wife's presence.

Feeling safe and comfort in his wife's presence, he spoke out his true feeling against Hitler.

Later, his wife quietly reported him to the Nazis.

He was arrested and sentenced to death.

After the fall of the Nazi regimes, his wife was put on trial.

Her defense? 

"I was just following the law."

But the court discovered that she was having an affair and used the system to get ride of her husband.

The court declared her guilty and the reason was for abusing the law but not for reporting her husband to his death.

Do you agree with the reasoning of the court for declaring her guilty?
