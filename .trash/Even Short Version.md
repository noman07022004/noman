**Title: “When Loyalty Becomes Betrayal”**

A Nazi soldier returned home from war—  
traumatized, but grateful to see his wife again.

One night, he quietly criticized Hitler.  
She listened. She comforted him.

The next day… she turned him in.

At his trial, she testified against him.  
He was stunned.  
He had survived the war—only to be betrayed by the one he loved most.

He was sentenced to death.

Years later, she was put on trial.  
Her defense?  
“I was just following the law.”

But the truth came out—  
she wasn’t loyal to the law...  
she was having an affair,  
and used the system to get rid of her husband.

She was sentenced to prison.  
Not for reporting him—  
but for using the law for personal gain.

Now the question is:  
**When law defies morality… is it still justice?**

**What do _you_ think?**
