When a Nazi soldier returned home from the war, he was traumatized yet relieved to finally be reunited with his wife. 

Haunted by his experiences, he quietly spoke out against Hitler, and his wife offered him comfort.

The next morning, however, she reported him to the Nazi authorities. He was swiftly arrested, and during his trial, her own testimony left him stunned. He was condemned to death.

After the regime collapsed, she too faced trial. Her defense was simple: "I was just following the law." 

But the court uncovered that her true motive was personal—she was having an affair and had exploited the system to eliminate her husband. Consequently, she was sentenced to imprisonment, not for reporting him, but for abusing the law.

Do you agree with the court’s reasoning in her punishment?
