Hours pass, the initial shock giving way to a heavy, emotionally charged stillness. Fang Yuan lies on the bed, his trembling having lessened slightly under Fang Sianer’s continuous infusion of essence, yet a deep-seated fear remains etched on his face, his gaze fixated on Yao Le. He has made several hesitant attempts to reach out to her, his trembling hand inching forward, only to falter mid-air, as if an invisible barrier held him back.

Fang Ma, observing this silent struggle, her heart aching, ponders aloud, her voice thick with unshed tears. "Before… before he… was lost to us again, he checked on Yao Le so desperately. He even held her for hours, a purely instinctive act, unable to hear or respond to anything else. And now… now he wakes, sees Yao Le, and this terror… this profound guilt… it overwhelms him." Her gaze drifts to Fang Yuan’s trembling form. "His whole body shakes, and no elixir has touched this. His eyes… they are terrified, fearful, locked on Yao Le. But… it doesn’t feel like he’s afraid of her…" She studies his trembling mouth. "It trembles, opening and closing… as if he’s trying to speak, but the words are trapped, lost." Her gaze falls to his outstretched, yet hesitant hand. "That hand… trembling, reaching, yet unable to touch her… as if he feels he doesn’t deserve to."

A sudden realization dawns on her, a chilling alignment with the fragmented memories of the novel. "The novel… the future self… he came back with memories, experiences, a changed personality. Cold. Calculating. He used people. And to advance his cultivation… the bear… the girl…" Her breath hitches, her own body momentarily trembling. "That’s it. Seeing Yao Le… the future self’s memories… they’re flooding him. Horrifying memories of… of what he did." The image of the bear, the brutal feeding, flashes in her mind, a sickening jolt of understanding. "My son… seeing that… seeing himself do that…" Tears well up again, her sobs returning. "What must he be feeling?"

But a fierce protectiveness hardens her gaze. "No. That brutality… that wasn't my son. That was the novel’s Fang Yuan. This… this is my Fang Yuan. My love." A plan begins to form in her mind. Should I keep Yao Le away from him? Would that bring him peace? A moment of consideration, then a resolute shake of her head. "No. That's running from it. The truth, even a perceived truth, needs to be confronted."

Her gaze softens as she watches Yao Le, who is whispering softly to Fang Yuan, trying to soothe his distress. "Brother Fang Yuan… I’m here. Please… be alright." A spark of an idea ignites in Fang Ma’s mind, a desperate gamble.

She moves to sit beside Yao Le, then looks at Fang Sianer, who is still tirelessly channeling her essence from behind Fang Yuan’s head. "Sianer, be ready. Continue your essence, but adjust your position. We need to… ground him." She then turns to Yao Le, her eyes filled with a determined urgency. "Yao Le, you are crucial now. We need him to believe… to know… that those memories aren’t his reality."

With gentle but firm movements, Fang Ma helps Fang Yuan sit up, leaning him against her chest. She carefully removes his shirt. "Sianer," she instructs softly, "channel your essence directly into his back now, focusing on calming his core." As Fang Sianer adjusts, her essence flowing, a subtle easing of Fang Yuan’s trembling becomes noticeable.

Fang Ma looks directly into Fang Yuan’s wide, terrified eyes. "My love," she says, her voice filled with unwavering conviction, though tears still trace paths down her cheeks. "Those… those were just bad dreams. Horrible nightmares that aren’t real. You have never done those things. Mama knows you. You would never do something like that. You don’t have to believe me. Check for yourself."

She gently takes his trembling hand and guides it, slowly, deliberately, towards Yao Le’s face. "Look," she whispers, making his fingertips brush her cheek. "This is Yao Le. She is completely fine. You have done nothing bad to her."

Yao Le, understanding instinctively, takes Fang Yuan’s hand in both of hers, pressing it to her cheek. "Yes, Brother Fang Yuan," she says, her voice thick with tears but firm with sincerity. "I’m alright. You’ve done nothing wrong."

Fang Ma guides his hand to Yao Le’s other cheek, then her nose, her hand, even briefly to her chest, her waist, her thigh. Yao Le, though a blush rises on her cheeks, meets his gaze steadily, even placing her own hands over his. "Look, my love," Fang Ma continues, her voice cracking with emotion. "She is completely fine. You’ve checked her completely, haven’t you? You have done nothing brutal or bad to her. This… this was just a terrible dream, a lie the darkness is trying to make you believe, to take you away from us. In reality, you are good. You will always be good. Can’t you see how everyone loves you? How they call you the Messenger of Love? The darkness is jealous of that light in you. It wants to make you someone else, so you stop helping others, stop bringing smiles. But Mama knows… one day, you will be the living embodiment of love itself." Her sobs return, wracking her body.

Yao Le, holding his hands tightly in hers, presses them to her own tear-streaked cheeks. "Yes, Brother Fang Yuan," she whispers, her voice trembling. "The darkness fears your light. Look at me. I am fine. You have done nothing bad to me. And I believe in you. One day, you will be love itself."

Slowly, almost imperceptibly, a change flickers in Fang Yuan’s eyes. Without their guidance, his trembling hand gently touches Yao Le’s cheek, his gaze meeting hers, a stark contrast to the averted eyes of moments before.

Hours drift by. Fang Sianer, her brow furrowed in intense concentration, continues to channel her calming essence into Fang Yuan. He leans against Fang Ma, who embraces him tightly, while Yao Le remains close, a tangible reassurance. The constant murmur of their voices, the gentle touch, the unwavering belief – it slowly begins to penetrate the terror.

Finally, his voice raspy, barely a whisper, Fang Yuan utters a single, broken sentence, his gaze locked on Yao Le’s tearful eyes, tears now tracing paths down his own cheeks. "Yao Le… I… am… happy… that… it… was… just… a bad… dream… and… you… are… okay…"

A choked sob escapes Yao Le. She throws her arms around him, hugging him fiercely, tears streaming anew. "Brother Fang Yuan! I am fine! I’m fine! I’m so happy!"

Fang Ma’s embrace tightens, relief washing over her in a powerful wave. "Yes, my love," she whispers, her voice thick with emotion. "Just a bad dream. Nothing more. You’ve done nothing wrong."

From behind, Fang Sianer, her own essence nearly depleted, her heart overflowing, sobs quietly as she hugs him tightly. "My love… you’re talking… I’m so happy…" The room is filled with the raw, overwhelming power of their love, a fragile dawn breaking after a long and terrifying night.
