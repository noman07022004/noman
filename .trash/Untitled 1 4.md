> Imagine returning from a deadly war to the arms of your beloved wife. You finally feel safe. In that moment, you speak out against the dictator. Later, you're arrested and sentenced to death.
> 
> This is the true story of a Nazi soldier.
> 
> One day, he came home on short leave, haunted by the horrors of war. Feeling secure with his wife, he confessed his hatred for Hitler. She comforted him—but later, quietly reported him to the Nazis.
> 
> He was arrested. Sentenced to death.
> 
> After the Nazi regime fell, his wife was put on trial. She defended herself, saying she was only following the law.
> 
> But the court uncovered something deeper: she was having an affair while her husband was at war. She had used the law to get rid of him.
> 
> The court found her guilty—not for reporting him—but for abusing the law for personal gain.
> 
> Do you agree with the court’s decision?
