> **A Nazi soldier returned home from the war on a short leave.**  
> 👉 _(Steady pace, neutral tone. Set the scene clearly.)_

> **He was traumatized by its horrors.**  
> 👉 _(Slight pause before “traumatized.” Lower your pitch and slow down to convey emotional weight.)_

> **But he found comfort in his wife’s presence.**  
> 👉 _(Warm tone, slight upward inflection on “comfort” and “wife’s presence.” Soften your voice.)_

> **Feeling safe, he spoke out against Hitler.**  
> 👉 _(Build slightly—small increase in pitch and intensity on “spoke out against Hitler.” This is a turning point.)_

> **Later, his wife quietly reported him to the Nazis.**  
> 👉 _(Drop your volume and slow the pace slightly—“quietly” should feel cold, calm, and eerie.)_

> **He was arrested and sentenced to death.**  
> 👉 _(Pause slightly before and after this sentence. Use a firm, flat tone with finality—emphasize “death.”)_

> **After the fall of the Nazi regime, his wife was put on trial.**  
> 👉 _(Resume normal pitch and pacing, reset the tone to "factual" or "narrative.")_

> **Her defense?**  
> 👉 _(Pause. Say this as a rhetorical question—short, sharp, with rising pitch.)_

> **“I was just following the law.”**  
> 👉 _(Quoted speech: mimic a cold, detached tone. Slightly slower, maybe even monotone.)_

> **But the court discovered she had been having an affair—and had used the system to get rid of her husband.**  
> 👉 _(Emphasize “had been having an affair”—use a disapproving or revealing tone. Pick up intensity slightly.)_

> **The court declared her guilty, not for sending her husband to his death, but for abusing the law for personal gain.**  
> 👉 _(Use a firm, deliberate tone. Emphasize “guilty,” “abusing the law,” and “personal gain.” Slow pace to let it sink in.)_

> **Do you agree with the court’s reasoning?**  
> 👉 _(Ask this slowly and clearly. Let your pitch rise slightly at the end to invite reflection.)_

### Vocal Techniques Summary:

- **Pitch**: Use higher pitch for questions or emotional highs, lower for serious or grim moments.
    
- **Pace**: Slow down for key emotional beats or heavy lines. Speed up slightly when giving background.
    
- **Volume**: Vary loudness to reflect intensity. Whispery or soft tones can be powerful for betrayal or shock.
    
- **Emphasis**: Highlight key words (e.g., _death_, _guilty_, _comfort_, _law_) to signal importance to the listener.
    
- **Pauses**: Strategic pauses let dramatic moments land and give your audience time to think.
