Hours bleed into the quiet room, the initial shock giving way to a heavy, emotionally charged stillness. Fang Yuan remains on the bed, his body still trembling, though perhaps with a fraction less intensity. His gaze, haunted and fearful, is fixed solely on Yao Le. He has yet to utter a word, but the raw anguish in his eyes speaks volumes. His hand trembles, hovering in the air, a hesitant extension towards Yao Le, a silent plea for something he feels he doesn't deserve – perhaps forgiveness, perhaps simply acknowledgment of his torment.

Fang Ma, her heart aching, observes every minute shift in her son's demeanor. _"Previously,"_ she ponders, her gaze softening as she recalls the earlier moments, _"before he succumbed, he desperately checked on Yao Le, held her for what felt like an eternity. He was lost then, driven by instinct, unable to hear or respond. Now…"_"* Her gaze returns to Fang Yuan's trembling form. _"His whole body is still shaking, despite all the elixirs. And that gaze… fixated on Yao Le. It’s fear, yes, but… it doesn’t feel like fear _of_ her."_ Her eyes trace the slight tremor of his lips. _"His mouth… it’s moving, just barely, opening and closing as if he’s struggling to find words, as if the very act of speaking has become a monumental effort."_ Then, her attention falls on his outstretched, trembling hand. _"That hand… reaching for her, so hesitant, so filled with an unspoken sorrow. It’s as if an invisible barrier prevents him from truly connecting."_

A sudden clarity pierces through her grief-laden thoughts. _"Now that I connect it to the novel… that horrific scene… there was nothing like this. The future Fang Yuan was cold, calculating, in complete control. He didn't show remorse, no such internal conflict. This… this isn't the future self taking over. This is… this is _my_ Fang Yuan reacting to the horror being forced upon him."_ A shudder runs through her. _"That brutal scene… just reading it made me sick. I can’t even begin to imagine seeing it, believing _I_ was the one who committed such an atrocity. What must he be feeling?"_ Tears well up again, silent sobs shaking her. She clutches Fang Yuan’s hand tightly. _"My poor boy… what you must be enduring…"_ But a fierce protectiveness твердеет her resolve. _"No. That monster in the novel is not my son. _This_ is my Fang Yuan. My love."_

A desperate plan forms in her mind. _"What should I do? Should I keep Yao Le away from him? Would that bring him peace?"_ After a moment, she shakes her head. _"No… the novel… it spoke of a ruthless future Fang Yuan, one who wouldn't hesitate to eliminate anyone he saw as an obstacle. Isolating Yao Le might even make things worse in the long run. I need to make him understand… that those weren't his actions. That it was just a nightmare."_

Her gaze softens as she looks at Yao Le, who is whispering soothing words to Fang Yuan. **"Brother Fang Yuan, I am here. Please… please be alright."** A spark of an idea ignites in Fang Ma’s mind. _"Yes… that’s it."_

She moves to sit beside Yao Le, then looks at Fang Sianer, who is still kneeling at Fang Yuan’s head, her face etched with worry. **"Sianer, prepare yourself. I need you to inject your martial essence into Fang Yuan again. This time… from his back."** She then turns to Yao Le, her eyes filled with a newfound urgency. **"Yao Le, you will be crucial in helping him believe."** Yao Le nods, confusion evident in her eyes but trust in her response.

Gently, Fang Ma helps Fang Yuan sit up, cradling him against her chest, and carefully removes his shirt. **"Sianer, now,"** she instructs, her voice firm. Fang Sianer, without hesitation, begins to channel her essence, the familiar warmth slowly easing some of the tension in Fang Yuan’s rigid body.

Looking directly into Fang Yuan’s wide, haunted eyes, Fang Ma speaks, her voice filled with a mother’s unwavering conviction. **"My love… all of that… those terrible things you saw… they were just bad dreams. They weren’t real. You have never done such a thing, and you never will. Mama knows you. Trust me."** She takes his trembling hand, guiding it to Yao Le’s cheek. **"Look. This is Yao Le. She is completely fine. You haven’t hurt her. Feel her."**

Yao Le, understanding instinctively, takes Fang Yuan’s hand in both of hers, pressing it to her cheek. **"Yes, Brother Fang Yuan. I’m alright. You’ve done nothing wrong."**

Fang Ma guides his hand to Yao Le’s other cheek, then her nose, her hand, even gently touching her chest, waist, and thigh. A faint blush rises on Yao Le’s face, but she meets Fang Yuan’s gaze steadily, even placing her own hands over his. **"See, my love?"** Fang Ma continues, her voice thick with unshed tears. **"She’s completely fine. You’ve checked her yourself, haven’t you? That brutality… that wasn’t you. It was just a nightmare, a cruel trick to make you doubt yourself, to push you away from us. The truth is, everyone loves you. They call you the Messenger of Love. That darkness… it’s jealous of the light you bring. Don’t let it win."** Her sobs return, shaking her body.

Yao Le takes both of Fang Yuan’s trembling hands in hers, pressing them against her cheeks, her own eyes now glistening with tears. **"Yes, Brother Fang Yuan. The darkness is afraid of your light. Look at me. I’m alright. You did nothing bad to me. I believe in you. I know the kind person you are."**

Slowly, almost imperceptibly, a change flickers in Fang Yuan’s eyes. Without prompting, his trembling hand gently touches Yao Le’s cheek, his gaze searching hers. He who couldn’t bear to look at her now seeks her eyes.

Hours drift by. Fang Sianer remains deeply focused, her essence a calming balm flowing into Fang Yuan. He leans against Fang Ma, her embrace a steady anchor, while Yao Le continues to offer silent reassurance through her touch and unwavering gaze.

Finally, his voice raspy, broken, but undeniably there, Fang Yuan utters a single, heart-wrenching sentence, his gaze locked on Yao Le’s eyes, tears tracing paths down his own cheeks. **"Yao Le… I… am… happy… that… it… was… just… a bad… dream… and… you… are… okay…"**

Relief washes over Yao Le in a powerful wave. She throws her arms around Fang Yuan, hugging him tightly, her own tears flowing freely. **"Brother Fang Yuan! I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m so happy!"** Fang Ma’s embrace tightens, her sobs now mingled with a profound relief. **"Yes, my love. Just a bad dream. Nothing more. You did nothing wrong."** Behind them, Fang Sianer, her own essence nearly depleted, lets out a shaky sob of pure joy, hugging him from behind. **"My love! My love! You’re talking! I’m so happy!"** The room, moments before filled with terror, now resonates with the overwhelming power of their love and the fragile dawn of recovery.
